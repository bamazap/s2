(8, 8, 'It''ll take a bunch of finesse and practice. It''s a great song that sounds spectacular if we put the time into it; it depends on whether we want to do that here or in a newer song. There are compelling arguments for picking this one: I don''t think we''ve done it in a while, Spanish would be cool, and it''s a solid bet. That said, spring break is awfully early in Lent this year (we did this a few years ago much closer to Holy Week). But it''s still Lent, so it''s still reasonable. -geofft ', 3, '2011-04-11 15:44:59'),

But I don''t have the usual praise song objection to it; it''s listenable, not that "me"-ish, not overly repetitive, pretty scriptural, etc. -geofft ', 3, '2011-04-12 23:17:52'),

It''s pretty cool to see that he wrote such a selfless song, especially after seeing the glitz and glam of Hollywood.\r\n\r\nI love it! It''s like a softer (but still poignant) version of Ruin Me. -Jacob\r\n\r\nIntriguing. Yeah, I can see it as a Ruin Me that''s more usable in sets and such. -geofft\r\n\r\nAlmost spring break compatible if we take out "Lord", which is possible. Very a cappella arrangeable, so that''s good :) I do like the lyrics a lot. -shion-\r\n\r\nI really like this song. -Kristina ', 3, '2011-04-12 23:21:54'),

But that was just my idea....\r\n\r\nReally wordy song - cas\r\n\r\nSo good! - everybody\r\n\r\nJust plain confessing Christ. Measureless did this a while back; iirc we did one soloist per verse, then all together on the last half stanza (where some versions repeat). This is what we believe, this is what we know. This is our hope, this is our joy. In Christ alone. -Ken ', 3, '2011-04-12 23:31:02'),

(16, 40, 'Succinctly describes a personal journey of faith and transformation by God''s truth. Slow jazzy-ish song (toward the end in particular), change of pace from everything else we perform. I think our current group would sound good on this song.', 3, '2011-05-12 13:12:26'),
(17, 394, 'I could see this song being very strong musically, perhaps as an opener or finale. The percussionist(s) are showcased. Since the song is so familiar, blurb would be necessary to bring attention to the message.', 3, '2011-05-12 14:13:53'),

(19, 245, 'It''s a proven winner, and I think it''s been long enough that we can bring this one back. Underneath the silliness, the song does a decent job of testifying to God''s love in an unassuming, non-threatening way.', 3, '2011-05-12 16:47:45'),
(21, 245, 'I think this perfect for Cross Products, and we should resurrect it at least every two years.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think we could brainstorm lyrics for an MIT audience... I noticed that our current lyrics are already slightly modified from the original Scott Krippayne song, and I think we could do a good job updating the lyrics.\r\nOne possibility that I brainstormed with Shion over spring break:\r\n\r\n...\r\nAnd coding is my claim to fame\r\nI spell "elite" using numbers (1337)\r\nIn fact, that''s my Kerberos name', 27, '2011-05-12 16:58:05'),
(22, 17, 'Cool-sounding girl solo, and the background isn''t too difficult (we did it in XLinked). The message reminds me a little of Who You Are, in a good way- God is unexplainable, yet He provides a "deep, deep reassurance" to those who "trust the unseen." It''s not going to be the hardest hitting song in the set message-wise, but it isn''t flippant either. It can contribute to the set both musically and spiritually.', 3, '2011-05-12 21:16:35'),
(23, 396, 'So it''s not done by a Christian artist, but it seems to be a song about a man searching for deeper meaning in his life (the official music video shows this unhappy guy surrounded by the gambling/amusement-park scene in Atlantic City.)  \r\nIt''s certainly a prayer I have in times of doubt for God to lead me past confusion and reveal himself/ will for me- to show me what I''m looking for. \r\n\r\nIt reminds me of "This is your Life" in that it is a spiritual song that can be sung in an explicitly non-Christian setting. Also- it''s been featured on a few TV shows so it''s recognizable which I guess is a plus? \r\n', 17, '2011-05-16 06:55:18'),

We rarely get to do real duets, let a lone a girl-guy duet, because usually those are love songs, but this is a love song about Jesus!   This song reminds us that the reason we''re all in this relationships with Jesus isn''t because we were super spiritual and smart and deep and "figured it out", but the Lord found and lead us to him. ', 17, '2011-05-16 07:07:07'),
(25, 398, 'What a cool verse rhythm!  Talks about the struggle of maintaining a close relationship with God when it''s so contrary to the world''s ways.  ', 17, '2011-05-16 07:18:40'),
(26, 397, '"When''s the last time we did a cute upbeat praise song that had an awesome girl-guy duet?" - That would be the last time we did You Found Me, which was last year :) It wouldn''t be a bad song to bring back, though!', 3, '2011-05-16 19:29:56'),
(27, 52, 'I really like this song- I think because the chorus reflects my prayers. In a works-based society, this song speaks to what we really need: the unconditional love of Christ. This song has a Country Music set up to it- taking different stories and applying the same chorus to it. And yes, it is predictable, but I think it has a great sweetness to it. If it were to be arranged, I think the arranger would need to add something a little different to each chorus repetition and verse just to keep it musically interesting, since it is a rather slow song lyrically (especially the bridge.)', 17, '2011-05-16 22:25:03'),
(28, 402, 'So besides Kristina, I''m sure none of us can smell the color 9. \r\nThis song isn''t the deepest of songs, but I think this song is a clever reminder of the reality that sometimes we just don''t feel God''s presence.', 17, '2011-05-16 22:35:45'),
(29, 402, 'hahahahahahaaa i started reading these lyrics and started laughing. i''m not sure i could keep a straight face during this song!! And then I actually listened to the song and he said "nine''s not a color". I was like grrrrrrrrrr maybe to you it''s not and got kinda really mad. >.<\r\n\r\nAnyway, I love the message of this song. I think what scares some people away from Christianity is the fear that they''ll try but they''ll never "get it" because they think Christianity is about having divine enounters and such. So yeah, this is a cool reminder that you don''t have to actually feel God or hear Him to still believe in Him and follow His will. Because, ultimately, He''s going to lead you to where He wants you to go, even if you''re not sure you''re heading in the right direction because you didn''t receive a "direct order".\r\n\r\nThe picture at the end with the butterfly and flower was fairly close! Nine''s a yellowy orange :)', 24, '2011-05-25 23:43:51'),

(32, 404, 'So, one day, we''re going to get to hang out with Christ forever!  That''s pretty cool.  I was thinking about how heaven fits in with our relationship with God.  We''re not in this relationship just for heaven and to get out of hell, but rather because heaven is a state where we can share with the ONE we love.  In the same way you don''t just get into a marriage for the money or sex, but rather it''s a state where you can express your love with no inhibitions.  Anyways now I''m rambling.  But I really love the female harmony part (go Dolly Parton!)  and think this would be a good spring break song.     ', 17, '2011-05-26 00:32:26'),
(33, 403, 'So I really wanted to suggest a low song- since a lot of guy songs are super high.  Also I love how this song is about how we can sing and speak all we want, but nothing we say or sing can ever describe how awesome our God is.  :-)(but we still gonna praise him) ', 17, '2011-05-26 00:45:11'),
(34, 397, 'I like the idea of a girl/guy duet, but this song sounds melody-less to me. It''s just kinda flat in the melody, if that makes any sense? That might not necessarily be bad, but I don''t like the lack of range very much.', 24, '2011-05-26 02:05:22'),
(35, 40, 'I love this song... Boston Found does it too :) For what it''s worth - this solo is either male or female - so I thought it was worth changing to reflect that. ', 32, '2011-05-26 02:08:50'),
(36, 245, 'Agreed with Peter.... adapting lyrics even moreso would be awesome. Truly, one of my favorite xprod songs of all time (and i never actually personally sang it!)  :D', 32, '2011-05-26 02:10:38'),
(37, 405, 'When I first heard this song, it was earlier this semester when I was really stressed out with school and was mad that I couldn''t ever seem to match up to how everyone else was performing. I was trying so hard to do well academically and this part of the song especially touched me "I know youre wanting to belong; they always tell you that you''re wrong... need a face, need a name, I''ve got a better way."', 24, '2011-05-26 02:23:08'),
(38, 405, 'Aw,  I do appreciate the lyrics of this song, although the song is a bit too poppy for my taste.  (but that''s what I thought about the LIGHTs song and then Peter''s arrangement made me really like it- so a good arrangement of this could prove me wrong again)  ', 17, '2011-05-26 17:54:48'),

(40, 397, 'Yeah that does make sense @ Kristina,  I think the background of this song is a heck a lot more musically interesting than the soloists. I''d really like to hear our arrangement of the song, if it was a kind of flat arrangement than that would change my opinion for voting.   ', 17, '2011-05-26 17:59:21'),
(41, 399, 'Okay I know this isn''t a readily accessible song for non-Christian audiences.  But I love how this song imagines us when Christ has finally come and returned, and we are just standing there as one people, worshiping him. I''d really love to try to convey that end-of-time image to our audience with this song.  I picture in the arrangement that we''d have multiple soloists for the verses, and just all stand and sing the chorus together, and that picture makes me happy :-) ', 17, '2011-05-26 18:07:45'),

(45, 406, 'Kristina wrote a song! And it''s catchy and nerd-ful. Pros: approaches the topic of God and physics coexisting like few songs do; "all you need has already been given" will get etched in the minds of an MIT audience.

I understand the words, but it doesn''t resonate, and it seems a bit scattered in terms of thoughts. -geofft\r\n\r\nthe verses are more scattered, but I do like the chorus. I think the verses make sense though, it''s just more metaphoric (like what nichole nordeman often does). I think if you take the whole song into context, then the message is great. i also like that solo. mmm last thing, i like the change between verse (quiet, sleeping) vs chorus (louder, vibrant) -shion-\r\n\r\nI like how the soloist is so confident in her faith. -Jacob\r\n\r\nGood song!

(55, 111, 'From the wiki: This song is sung from the perspective of God. He is speaking to a sinner who has neglected his faith to focus on worldly things but is turning back to God after hardship involving, in particular, persecution from friends/family/etc. If something bad happens to you that causes you to become closer to God, the silver lining more than outweighs the cost! Musically, it''s very Flyleaf. I wish it was a little shorter. But if you listen closely to the background especially during the verse, there are some moving parts that would be interesting in a cappella. -Jacob\r\n\r\nI''m intrigued. The verses are about finding concerns for social justice and looking beyond the wisdom of the world driving your search to God, instead of the other way around as usually portrayed, which is kind of cool. -geofft ', 3, '2011-05-30 00:06:45'),

I think it expresses our desire and the fact that we live loving and wanting to know more about Christ- even after the songs we stop, the concerts, the rehearsals end. We don''t just sing Christian a cappella. It''s not just a student group that we''re part of or something we do on occasion like many other things we do, but loving God is our life and purpose. I also like how it portrays this message with joy and an upbeat rhythm. I think the chorus and the bridge (more so than the verses) have the "core" of the message. \r\n-shion\r\n\r\nIt''s a decent song, but it seems to me like a praise song that can''t easily be a performance song (see the criticism of Indescribable, which I don''t actually think applies there): it''s not something I can really respond to someone else singing.

I''m so glad this song was suggested again. The message that we should love God is a great one- this song could contribute much to our set both in terms of message and musical variety. - Jacob I don''t see an issue with the bridge; I see it in terms of Philippians 3 "I consider all things rubbish compared to knowing God" etc. I think we should be able to follow through on such promises (like Luther''s "God, if you save me from this thunderstorm, I''ll become a monk!"). Anyway. I like the song, it''s clear, it gets a message across that is worthwhile and sufficiently different from some of the messages we tend to focus on, and the verse is pitched so we are bounded on exactly how much we can make fools of ourselves. :) And the phrase "I was made to love you" is pretty memorable. -geofft [edit] Comments Song Party the rap isn''t like...hardcore rap. so i think that''s singable -shion- the bridge? a bit of mush-fluff? it''s a good profession of love that people use, but it might not mesh with the message of the song which is stronger.-daniel- if it''s a statement of God''s value, then it''s good. but if it''s a statement of our intent, then it''s lame. do we follow through on promises like that? i''d be willing to give up anything for you vs ill do anything for you.-daniel/martin- [edit] Comments Fall 2009 This is a little bit different from our normal style of songs, but it might add some variety to a set and I think it would make an interesting a capella arrangement.

On the one hand, it''s unreasonable/impossible for us to reach out to absolutely everyone we know and give them spiritual support, much less prevent them from committing suicide if they are so inclined. On the other hand, I think we (meaning both us and the audience) tend to err on the side of not being caring enough toward the people around us. When YOU are despairing, even JUST ONE person sitting down and talking with you and making you feel loved can make a HUGE difference. When that person is a Christian who loves you because God first loved them, it''s that much more powerful. I have always found this song annoying, but if anyone is going to sing it, it should be the Christian a cappella group at an institution with a tragically high suicide percentage.

Luke explained, "Joel came to me in the studio that day and told me he wanted to write something that would gently nudge and encourage people and at the same time challenge them. That''s a very difficult line to balance. People don''t want to be challenged too much and be turned away. When we were looking at the Bible passage 1 Corinthians 13, we knew there was something significant that we hadn''t written about. We decided to put those words into this song. That''s how the song came to be." Joel also explained, "Adding to that, there''s a powerful message in proclaiming those truths from God''s Word first. The lyrics have me singing, "If I sing, but don''t have love, I waste my breath with every song." Rather than have this be a judgment to listeners, it''s time for me to proclaim it.

But at the very beginning of this song, the singer clearly states that he''s (and in fact we all are) not skilled to understand the will of God, but the one thing that he''s sure of is his Savior and that he takes Him at his word when He says that He came and died to save us.

However when Stephen the martyr was getting stoned he did pray to God for a similar thing  "Lord, do not hold this sin against them" (Acts 7:59,60).  and also the stanza points out that those who wrong us need forgiveness from God/ we all do (even moreso than from each other.)   but I was really struck by the rest of the song (also a pity that the meatiest part of the song lyrically happens to be the quickest (not like it''s super fast or anything it''s just quicker relatively during the bridge)... so enunciation/ not rushing will be critical for that if this were picked...

Living Water sang this song at Milford Bible Church 10 minutes from where I lived, and I had no idea what the song was either before I went.  But Zachary gave a one minute blurb that if I can remember correctly (and I haven''t read the book, so please forgive me for any error), that this song is drawn from CS Lewis'' book The Great Divorce (on the spot Dorothy), and his description of the High Countries.  There were two people, the people in the High Countries, and the gray people, people that lived in a world where houses grew further and further apart, as the people grew further apart.  Separating the two lands was a giant field that as you walked through it, would cut you to pieces, break you down.  And so the song enters this tale, singing of a person that is leaving the great grey land, to go to the higher countries.  And as they travel to higher and more beautiful ground, it is asking if you will continue on, to fall to pieces for what lies beyond?  The last part of the last verse really captures this when it says, "Out on the green plains, I am but a ghost./Bound up with all that I call mine, still the light grows."  It emphasizes how different we are from Christ, and that as we come home to his land, all that we are falls apart, so that all that remains is all that he has for us, a weight of glory far greater than all our treasure.   The blurb that Zachary gave was sadly not included in the youtube clip, but I do hope to ask him about it.

Similarly, I feel that if we''re going to say "heaven has a plan for you," we need to make it clear that we are NOT subscribing to some sort of prosperity gospel, and should talk about the things that we have been promised. But even if we fix this and similar lyrical problems in an XProd version, I''m still unsure as to where exactly the substance is coming from.

In The Great Divorce, Lewis presents an allegory for both heaven and hell.  The people from the Shadow Countries ("hell"), including the narrator, come via bus to the plains at the base of "the High Countries" (heaven).  They find that everything about the High Countries is so much more real, more solid, than they are, that even the grass of the plain cuts their feet.  The only way to reach the high countries is to agree to be be torn apart by this realness and be made real yourself.  Thus, when the chorus asks "Would you fall to pieces in the High Countries?" it calls us to ask whether we are willing to submit ourselves to the painful process of sanctification."\r\nHe also shared this link with me, which I really think goes into the entire depth of the song and Lewis''s image of the high countries.

Not to mention that I often felt growing up that love was conditional on performance, and I feel like that''s a common thing people at MIT have believed at some point, Christian or not, so communicating the unconditional love of God in an accessible way is so critical to our ministry on this campus.', 56, '2014-01-09 00:36:31'),

Also, it may be cool to mash this up with This Little Light of Mine- I don''t know if chord progressions work or anything, but Caitlin has the idea of This Little Light of Mine in a mashup and this could be a potential partner song since the themes are essentially the same.\r\nMaddie @ 2014-05-17 02:20:09', 38, '2014-06-05 06:18:06'),

I hope that makes sense. It''s kinda hard to explain in words, haha.
