"6","6","I was certain that i knew You
At the tender age of twelve
You'd so often been described by those
Who said they knew You well
Dark and rugged in Your thirties
With a smile as bright as Your robe

Every teacher, every preacher
With the very best intent
Found new ways to hide the mystery
Replaced by common sense
And to know You was to keep You in my pocket
So easy to hold

I know I can't explain You
I would not even try to
And yet it's clear that You are here beside me
I marvel and I wonder
So near and somehow still so far
What makes You who You are?

It is easy to insist
On what is packaged and precise
And dismiss the clear suspicion
That You're bigger than we'd like
It is tempting to regard You as familiar
In so many ways

I've tried to draw these lines around You
A definition or an absolute
But i could not be satisfied with black or white
There is so much more
There is so much You

"8","8","Down the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem that day
The soldiers tried to clear the narrow street
But the crowd pressed in to see
The Man condemned to die on Calvary

He was bleeding from a beating, there were stripes upon His back
And He wore a crown of thorns upon His head
And He bore with every step
The scorn of those who cried out for His death

Down the Via Dolorosa called the way of suffering
Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King,
But He chose to walk that road out of
His love for you and me.
Down the Via Dolorosa, all the way to Calvary.

Por la Via Dolorosa, triste dia en Jerusalen
Los soldados le abrian paso a Jesus.
Mas la gente se acercaba,
Para ver al que llevaba aquella cruz.

Por la Via Dolorosa, que es la via del dolor
Como oveja vino Cristo, Rey y Senor,
Y fue El quien quiso ir por su amor por ti y por mi.
Por la Via Dolorosa al Calvario y a morir.

The blood that would cleanse the souls of all men
Made its way through the heart of Jerusalem.

"9","9","Before the throne of God above, 
I have a strong, a perfect plea, 
A great High Priest whose name is ""Love,"" 
Who ever lives and pleads for me. 
My name is graven on His hands, 
My name is written on His heart; 
I know that while in heav'n He stands 
no tongue can bid me thence depart. 
No tongue can bid me thence depart. 

When Satan tempts me to despair, 
and tells me of the guilt within, 
upward I look and see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin. 
Because the sinless Savior died, 
my sinful soul is counted free; 
For God, the Just, is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me. 
to look on him and pardon me. 

Behold him there! the risen Lamb, 
my perfect, spotless Righteousness, 
the great unchangeable I AM, 
the King of glory and of grace! 
One with Himself I cannot die, 
My soul is purchased by His blood; 
My life is hid with Christ on high, 
with Christ, my Savior and my God 
with Christ, my Savior and my God "

I'm a bit of a manic when it's not as I plan it, 
'Cause I start losing my head

And always knew when to quit it
Are we denying a crisis, or are we scared of admitting it?

In these nights of a restless remorse,
When the heart and the soul of the nation,

From the grave of the innocent Adam,
comes a song bringing joy to the sad.
Oh your cry has been heard and the ransom,
has been paid up in full, Be Ye Glad.

Oh, Be Ye Glad, Be Ye Glad,
Every debt that you ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord,
Be Ye Glad, Be Ye Glad, Be Ye Glad.

From the dungeon a rumor is stirring.
Though you have heard it again and again.
But this time your cell keys are turning,
and outside there are faces of friends.
And though your body lay weary from wasting,
and your eyes show the sorrow they've had.
Oh the love that your heart is now tasting
has opened the gate, Be Ye Glad.

(Chorus)

So be like lights on the rim of the water,
giving hope in a storm sea of night.
Be a refuge amidst the slaughter,
for these fugitives in their flight.
For you are timeless and part of a puzzle.
You are winsome and young as a lad.
And there is no disease or no struggle,
that can pull you from God, Be Ye Glad.

Fighting off the bitter cold when she caught my eye
Her face was taut and her eyes were filled and to my surprise
She pulled out a photograph and my heart just stopped inside
She said, ""He would have been three today. I miss his smile. I miss his face.""
What was I supposed to say?

But I believe always, always
Our savior never fails
Even when all hope is gone
God knows our pain 
And his promise remains.
He will be with you always

He was living in a broken world dreaming of a home
His heart was barely keeping pace when I found him all alone
Remembering the way he felt when his daddy said goodbye
Fighting just to keep the tears and the anger locked inside
He's barely holding on to faith 
But deliverance is on its way

'Cause I believe always, always
Our savior never fails.
Even when all hope is gone
God knows our pain 
And his promise remains
He will be with you always

Friend, I don't know where you are 
And I don't know where you've been.
Maybe you're fighting for your life 
Just about to throw the towel in, 
But if you 're crying out for mercy 
If there's no hope left at all
If you've given everything you've got
And you're still about to fall
Well hold on
Hold on
Hold on

When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But, Lord, â€˜tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul."

Time was never cash, life is still more than girls
Life is more than hundred dollar bills and roto-tom fills

As thou hast been, thou forever will be

Our love for each other was so pure.
I looked out for you, you reached out to me.
We would never be separated by simple aberration,
-cause of regular collaborations.
Yes, our times together were so sweet and
on the weekends we would have our meetings.
You were seeking my attention,
you called me every single day for – conversation.
You were confident even when the problems hit.
Obstacles and potholes were challenges.
You trusted me – amidst your disarray.
I hoped you stayed to hear – what I had to say.
My encouragement – was your strength to carry on,
even though you relied on Dom Perignon.
You wanted a higher love, I provided.
-You are my bride, why did you fight it?

(Verse 2 – J. Han)

No matter what the world says about you.
Truth – will always stand and it’ll bear fruit.
Sometimes you’re embarrassed of me
and yet so arrogant to your peers like pharisees.
Heresy floats on the surface.
Instead of building on my rock, you decide to throw them.
You would greet me with a cloaked passion
but lacked the – compassion, you actor.
You act up, attracted to blasphe-
“me, myself, and I” – mentality.
The fallacy in that you ain’t really worthy
you’re not the master says Luke 17.
I married you, I’ve tasted the tea you brewed
If you ain’t hot for me, then you’re dispensable.
I don’t care how sweet you were.
Today make sure you pick up your cross and follow my word.

(Verse 3 – Sam Ock)

You’re holding out for something big to happen
All you really need are my arms to be wrapped in
You know that, but you refuse to admit that I am the only one that you’re lackin
What happened to the passion? You’re lazy
Letting all the stupid things drive you crazy
I told you, I am everything you’re ever gonna need
So please let go of it all,
You see the pain that I felt for you then?
The gift you received with your every single “amen?
It’s been a few days, months, or years since the last time I took away your fears, your tears
I miss you…well did you know that?
I paid the price so you never gotta look back
All I want is to love and be loved in return.

Great is thy faithfulness

You lift us up on wings like eagles"

In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

What I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)

"214","214","in the garden long ago
love was all there was to know
pure, innocent and free
like we were meant to be
long ago

afraid we followed after lies
and pain filled the Father's eyes
but oh from the first we knew
what He'd planned to do
to bring us home

(Chorus)
God so loved the world that He gave His only Son
to face the death that we deserved and overcome
and everyone who hears His word and believes the promise that he's heard will never die
never die

hope -- like an unexpected friend
came to the helpless and condemned
and peace was offered far and near
to answer every fear in our hearts

grace -- only God could understand
flowed freely from His hands
when the perfect Lamb was slain to bear the guilt and shame
of us all

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
thru His death our forgiveness was obtained
and heaven can be claimed once again
thru His life He's crushed the power of sin
now we can reign with Him forevermore

God so loved the world..."

Philippians 4:4-7
Attributed to John Redford (d. 1547)

Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again
I say: Rejoice.  Let your moderation
be known unto all men.  The Lord is
e'en at hand.  Be careful for nothing,
but in all prayer and supplication, let
your petitions be manifest unto God with
giving of thanks.  And the peace of God
which passeth all understanding keep your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."

When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

There is no life - no life without its hunger;
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;

"219","219","So how did I get to this place? 
Thought it all was going as I'd planned. 
Laid down the perfect road to take.
And how did I get so caught up 
in all the familiar things, 
so terrified to even take a chance?

But You said if I took a step of faith 
that You could show me a life 
so much more worth living. 
So I'm thinking,

What am I waiting for? 
Am I just passing on through this life?
But I've been headed down this road for so long.
Can I learn to let it go? 
Trust my life in the hands of my Creator?
For I know You are all that's good in me. 
I've felt Your love running through my veins. 
You're all I need.
What am I waiting for?

Cut through the safety lines I've built,
so I can't deny Your faithfulness, 
can't call it coincidence.
Help me to put aside my plans and ask for Yours, 
so You're dwelling in my heart, renewing my mind.

And oh, I'm so tired of running in circles. 
I'm ready to take a step of faith
and go where you lead me.

CHORUS x2

For I know You are all that's good in me. 
I've felt Your love running through my veins
You're all I need You're all I need
You're all I need. You're all I need, all I need. 
You're all I need.
What am I waiting for?

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus take the wheel

Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel

Oh, take it, take it from me.
Oh, wow, ohhhhh."

Filling us with joy, all of this will glorify.

I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity
You are everything that is bright and clean
The antonym of me
You are divinity
But a certain sign of grace is this
From the broken earth flowers come up 
Pushing through the dirt

You are holy, holy, holy
All heaven cries ""Holy, holy God""
You are holy, holy, holy
I want to be holy like You are

You are everything that is bright and clean
And You're covering me with Your majesty
And the truest sign of grace was this
From wounded hands redemption fell down
Liberating man
But the harder I try the more clearly can I feel
The depth of our fall and the weight of it all
And so this might could be the most impossible thing
Your grandness in me making me clean

Glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
So here I am, all of me
Finally everything
Wholly, wholly, wholly
I am wholly, wholly
I am wholly, wholly, wholly
Yours

You, You've found me.
You found me and You called me from the wilderness,
From my cave of emptiness,
Yeah, You, You've found me.
You found me in the places of my lonliness
You told me there was more than this,
You captured me with tenderness,
Yeah, You've found me.

There was so many days, trying to
figure out ways to explain what I feel inside,
I tried to fill up my soul without

I'm ready to give in
I know I'll never win
The hide and seek that I've been in

"398","398","[Intro: Lecrae]
It's Gravity
Keeps pullin' me down

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Listen!
I pen songs for the perishin' and parishioners
Them hearers and them listeners, the home and the visitors
This is not a game, you can't tame or make it purty
They say the earth cursed, so our mouths stay dirty
There's mud on the track, a slug in ya' back
Police done pulled you over with' a gun in ya' lap
And you ain't got the power to make it through this parade
The workers can't keep the profit - everything here is vain
My job is oppressive, I strive for my blessings
The pastor so corrupt it's hard to ride with his message
Riches destroy the owners, the government think they own us
My onus is to keep the police from ridin' all up on us
Leavin' money to kids who spend it on getting' blitz
Say, what's the point of livin' just to give it up in the end
Then again, all my sin has been pinned to the cross
I know I'm free forever from this land of the lost

[Hook: J.R.]
Yeah, every time I think I'm flying
I'm just falling
So close to touching the sky
But gravity keeps pulling me back down
But I can't stay here forever
I want to go, ooh one day!
I want to go
Somewhere where there's no gravity

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Somebody told me there was no such thing as truth
I said, ""If that's the case then why should I believe you?""
Murder, money, and mayhem, every place that I lay in
My problems follow suit, I'm tailor-made for this, ain't I?
It's deep. You wanna go deep? I'll take you deep
Reality is really just cheap
Yo' eyes wide open apparently, but you sleep
And everything you have in your hands you'll never keep
So why hold on, I flow on to go on, before long I float on
Eternal life is what I'm thinkin' I'm a bank my hope on
Believe me, easy is irrelevant
The devil want us burning for the hell of it
Elephants in the room say we can't talk about impending doom
Or we gospel rappin' or preaching people out of their shoes
It's cool, I'll be that dude. We glued to our depravity,
Until somebody free us from this gravity. Fly!

I've been splitting hairs and blurring lines

Lifted high, lifted high

I'm a liar who thirsts for the truth

I need to feel the scars and see the proof

Lifted high, lifted high |

Of our souls
And if we just keep cutting all the chains from our hearts
We'll lose control

It feels like starting over
It feels like waking up, and you know it's coming
It feels like a brand new day

So go ahead and set up your system of equations

What is the way to where the bolts of lightning disperse?

Unless acted on by some unseen force
Gravity isn't always the reason why people fall
That's when you count on grace to help you up and stand tall


Is love conserved when it falls from the sky?
How can you tell when it's an endless supply?
To say it's static is a little strange
But then by definition it will never change

So long status quo
I think I just let go
You make me want to be brave
The way it always was
Is no longer good enough
You make me want to be brave
Brave, brave

I am small
And I speak when I'm spoken to
But I am willing to risk it all
I say Your name
Just Your name and I'm ready to jump
Even ready to fall...

Why did I take this vow of compromise?
Why did I try to keep it all inside?

So long status quo
I think I just let go
You make me want to be brave
The way it always was
Is no longer good enough
You make me want to be brave
Brave, brave

I've never known a fire that didn't begin with a flame
Every storm will start with just a drop of rain
But if you believe in me
That changes everything
So long, I'm gone

So long status quo
I think I just let go
You make me want to be brave
I wanna be brave
The way it always was
Is no longer good enough
You make me want to be brave
Brave, brave"

off with the old plan.

about an empty funeral.
But it was better than the party
full of people I don't really know.
Well, they've got hearts to break and burn,
dirty hands to feel the earth.
I've got something in my veins,
but I can't seem to make it work...
...won't work.

I'm just a dead man,
lying on the carpet,
can't find a heartbeat.

I'm tired of the old one;
off with the old plan.

Any pulse? Getting worse...

She didn't care to glance behind
And through her tears she laughed
It's time to kiss the past goodbye

Tell me how this story ends

How amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name

I will lift my eyes
In the darkest night
For I know my Savior lives
And I will walk with You
Knowing You'll see me through
And sing the songs You give

(Chorus)

I can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win
I can sing when I lose my step
And fall down again
I can sing 'cause You pick me up
Sing 'cause You're there
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord
When I call to You in prayer
I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know
That I'll sing with the angels
And the saints around the throne

When I get home to that good land
I want to shout salvation's story
In concert with the blood-washed band
I'm going there to meet my Saviour
To sing his praise forever more
I'm just a going over Jordan

So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

[Verse 1:]
It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just going lose my soul
And my ways ain't purified, don't live according to Your Word
I can't endure this life without Your wisdom being heard
So word to every dance, a foe, a pop star
'Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rockstar
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright
So let me fall back, stop giving my suggestions
'Cause when I follow my obsessions, I end up confessing
That I'm not that impressive, matter of fact
I'm who I are, a trail of stardust leading to the superstar

[Verse 2:]
I had a dream that I was captain of my soul
I was master of my fate, lost control. and then I sank
So I don't want to take the lead, 'cause I'm prone to make mistakes
All the folks who follow me, going end up in the wrong place
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
'Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, 'cause I only trust in me
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, You know what's in my hand
Me, I'm just going to trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is you the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background, like it's an instrument

[Bridge:]
I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really Glorify Your name
And it's a shame, the way I want to do these things for You
Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and gleam from You
Seems You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's 'cause she never heard of this

When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark.
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

Fight back the flight deck,
Bring on the break neck
Cue the solar eclipse
Summit the sunset
Dubtail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits.

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark.
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

Oh telescope,
Keep an eye on my only hope,
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road,
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me,
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need.
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, galaxies)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far."

So reclaim my name from the lost and found
Ya see, something's got me jumpin'
And I think it's the way
That He can take a hard man
And turn him into soft clay
Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I once was lost but I'm free at last!

Oppression was in session and my life was the term
But when I heard about the Word I was willing to learn
About a flavor I could savor and a brighter tomorrow
Cause this could never be endeavored by a wish on a star
The Father first receives us, the Truth then frees us
Forgiven, now I'm living like a man full of Jesus
It was hell until I fell upon my knees and prayed
But now the yoke that I was totin' has been taken away

(repeat chorus 1)

Cause I'm free, free at last, free
From my past, free from sin, and I'm free
And down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't, no I ain't going back again

Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I was once lost but I'm free at last

I'm here to tell you what he did for me and
I'm here to tell you that he set me free and
I know that He can do the same for you, too
He did it, I'm wit it, so come and get it
Be free at last!

When all of God's children: black men and white men,
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands and
Sing in the words of the old negro spiritual...

Cause I'm free, free at last, cause I'm free
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't, no I ain't going back again
Thank God I'm free

Thank God almighty we are free at last! "

They knew God had come to Earth

That Her baby, not yet speaking,
Was the Word of God to man
He would tell them of His kingdom
But their hearts would not believe
They would hate Him, and in anger
They would nail Him to a tree

But the sadness would be broken
As the Son of life arose
And the Firstborn of creation
Would ascend and take His throne
He had left it to redeem us
But before His life began
He knew He'd come back, not as a baby
But as the Lord of every man

On the morning of His birth
But how much greater will our song be

Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street.
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song.
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known.
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment.
I, without the cross there's only condemnation.
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration.
So in times that are good, in times that are bad
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad.
And I will boast in the cross. I'll boast in my pains.
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign.

If we fought for our rights, we'd be in hell tonight.
Mere sinners owed nothing but a fierce hand.
We never loved him, we pushed away his pierced hands.
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy.
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty.
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?
Patiently you turned my heart away from selfishness.
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery.
I know the Spirit's purging me of everything that's hurting me.
Remove the veil from my darkened eyes.
So now every morning I open your word and see the Son rise.
I hope in nothin, boast in nothin, only in your suffering.
I live to show your glory, dying to tell your story.

"529","529","We rode into town the other day 
Just me and my Daddy 
He said I'd finally reached that age 
And I could ride next to him on a horse 
That of course was not quite as wide

We heard a crowd of people shouting 
And so we stopped to find out why 
And there was that man 
That my dad said he loved 
But today there was fear in his eyes

So I said ""Daddy, why are they screaming? 
Why are the faces of some of them beaming? 
Why is He dressed in that bright purple robe? 
I'll bet that crown hurts Him more than He shows 
Daddy, please can't you do something? 
He looks as though He's gonna cry 
you said he was stronger than all of those guys 
addy, please tell me why 
Why does everyone want him to die?""

Later that day the sky grew cloudy 
And Daddy said I should go inside 
Somehow he knew things would get stormy 
Boy was he right 
But I could not keep from wondering 
If there was something he had to hide

So after he left I had to find out 
I was not afraid of getting lost 
So I followed the crowds 
To a hill where I knew men had been killed 
And I heard a voice come from the cross

And it said, ""Father, why are they screaming? 
Why are the faces of some of them beaming? 
Why are they casting their lots for My robe? 
This crown of thorns hurts Me more than it shows 
Father, please can't You do something? 
I know that You must hear My cry 
I thought I could handle the cross of this size 
Father, remind Me why 
Why does everyone want Me to die? 
When will I understand why?""

""My precious Son, I hear them screaming 
I'm watching the face of the enemy beaming 
But soon I will clothe You in robes of My own 
Jesus, this hurts Me much more than You know 
But this dark hour I must do nothing 
Though I've heard Your unbearable cry 
The power in Your blood destroys all of the lies 
Soon You'll see past their unmerciful eyes 
Look there below, see the child 
Trembling by her father's side 
Now I can tell You why 
She is why You must die"

Make straight the paths that crooked lie

But like a hero in a dream 
Christ came and He rescued me! 
Now I'mma tell the world, tell the world, tell em 
I'mma tell it everywhere I go 
Tell the world, tell em 
Yea I'm a billboard 
Tell the world, and I'll 
broadast Him like a radio 
Tell the world ""you oughta know 
I'm brand new.""

(Verse 2) 
I can't offer you nothin, but your care and kindness keep comin 
And your love is so unconditional, I get butterflies in my stomach 
I got the old me in the rearview, gotta new me, gotta clear view 
I was so dead, I couldn't hear you 
Too deep in sin to come near you 
But you drew me in, you cleaned me up 
So take me home, beam me up 
Before you do, just let me tell the truth 
And let these folks know that I done seen your love 
And it's everlastin, infinite 
It goes on and on, you can't measure it 
Can't quench your love, they can't separate us from the love of God 
There's no estimate 
My face look the same, my frame been rearranged 
But I'm changed, I promise I aint the same 
Your love's so deep, you suffered and took pain 
You died on the cross to gimme a new name 
Aint nothin like I seen before 
I gotta beam to glow 
Was low, down, and dirty but you cleaned me Lord 
You adopted after me, you keep rockin me 
Imma tell the world that aint nobody stoppin me 

(Chorus) 

(Verse 3; 2 Corinthians 5:17) 
So therefore, if anyone is in Christ, 
He's a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 
Yea, I'm brand new  "

"554","554","Woke up this morning too depressed, ashamed to leave my bed;
Can't stand to see my own reflection so I hang my head.
Feel like a disappointment, like the scum of the earth!
I'm so hurt; I know you see I can't cover my dirt.
My souls dying, hearts weak; I can't even cry!
I'm supposed to run to you but WHY I'm such an evil guy.
The sun's shining, but for me it's the darkest of days.
Try to pretend it never happened but the guilt remains!
I leave the house; it feels like everybody knows I did it.
Feel like they reading my mind and know the sin I committed!
Through your blood I'm acquitted, but my heart doesn't get it;
Oh God I'm desperate for help, cause I'm grieving your Spirit.
I couldn't sing in Sunday service, Lord I felt fake!
And when they started communion I just made an escape!
I'm in need of your grace, feels like you hid your face;
Lord, lead me back to the cross and show me my sins erased!

(Chorus)
I'm so desperate, I can't believe I've sinned against you.
Create in me a clean heart, (I'm so sorry)
Your mercy is what I need.
(x2)

I'm waste deep in my pity, is Satan tryna trick me?
And tell me you won't forgive me, cause it's startin' to get me.
Jesus help me quickly, I hate the wrong I've done;
I know we all fall but I feel like the only one!
Feels like I should be shunned, should I punish myself?
I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt.
But my sin has been felt, I didn't want to do it!
But what I want to do I don't, I swear I'm going through it!
I'm tryna open up my Bible, need to read your pages;
I need you Lord but my guilt has got me feeling so faithless.
Help me see where grace is, take me to the basics.
Help me find my joy in you and not people and places!
My sin is ever before me, I turned my back on you;
Oh father break and restore me and bring me back to you!
My sin is ever before me, I turned my back on you!
God, break and restore me and bring me back to you!

(Chorus)

Have mercy on me God according to your steady love.
Wipe away my transgressions and wash me in your blood.
Create in me a clean heart, renew a right spirit;
Don't hide your face from me, God, your presence keep me near it!
I'm waiting patient on you Lord, I know you hear my cry.
Restore your Joy in me, for you alone I live and die!
It's you I glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice.
You want me broken and contrite and trusting in the Christ!
I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy;
I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy.
Over lust, over pride, over all sin,
Is my affection for Jesus who died for all them!
I was lost, now I'm found; I was toss to the ground.
My sin weighed on me heavy but I'm no longer bound!
As sure as Christ wears the crown, I know that grace will abound;
And even when I feel lost, I know in You I am found!

"555","555","Hello mercy, I have been searching for you lately.
I've been wounded and from what I hear, you have the remedy.
They told me you would be for me, so now I need to know,
Is this a love that can save me or say you will then don't?
Will you stay with me when nobody is around?
If this is real, then tell me now.

Can you hold me together;
Can your love reach down this far?
Can you hold me together?
Cause without You holding my heart,
I'm falling apart.
Falling apart.

Saying so long, been lost, been gone, not sure what to pray.
It's not easy but I know You see me when I lose my way
I keep on floating not knowing if there is more for me
Don't want to sink beneath waves of negativity
I'm going under, I'm afraid that I might drown;
If this is real, I need you now!

Can you hold me together;
Can your love reach down this far?
Can you hold me together?
Cause without You holding my heart,
I'm falling apart.
Falling apart.
Hold me Lord!

I'm feeling stronger, with you by my side!
And I realize You are my hope, and I need to know,

Can you hold me together;
Can your love reach down this far?
Can you hold me together?
Cause without You holding my heart,
I'm falling apart.
Falling apart, yeah.
Hold me together Lord!

Without You,
I'm falling apart.
Falling apart."
"556","556","I wish I could cross my arms
And cross your mind 'cause I believe
You'd unfold your paper heart
And wear it on your sleeve

All my life I wish I broke mirrors
Instead of promises
'Cause all I see is a shattered conscience
Staring right back at me

I wish I had covered all my tracks completely
'Cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel
Or just the train?

Lift your arms, only Heaven knows
Where the danger grows and it's safe to say
There's a bright light up ahead
And help is on the way, help is on the way

I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me

Depression, please cut to the chase
And cut a long story short
Oh, please be done, how much longer
Can this drama afford to run?

Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties
And breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then, all my heavy hopes
Just pull me back down again

I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me

Then I was given grace and love
I was blind but now I can see
'Cause I found a new hope from above
And courage swept over me

It hurts just to wake up
Whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside
So tired of looking in

The end is uncertain
And I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope
To see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave"

In the seasons when I’m all out of luck.
In the moments when I’m all crawled up.
In the days when I’m feeling really drained
running in a loopy maze of a life and begin to feel jaded.
I’m hidden in my bunker when the war goes on
while singing a somber song.
It’s the beginning of my demise.
All of my hope is gone; I am but just a pawn.
My life’s feeling like a neglected tool.
When I dine with the swine, is God there too?
If I get the short end of the stick,
will I be able to build a grand staff with the twigs?
But then I’m reminded I’m a beloved
son of a God who’s got dominion over the summit.
Romans 8:28 - man, I stand on it.
This is gonna be my banner; put a flag on it!

It doesn't matter what you've heard
Impossible is not a word
It's just a reason
For someone not to try

Everybody's scared to death
When they decide to take that step
Out on the water
It'll be alright

You will find your way

You don't have a chance

It'll tell you that you can

feeling like there's nothing that I can't try

This is my story this is my song
if you aint got the heart, don't attempt to try this at home

now I'm in the zone, tell the World I'm coming home
been a long time coming, been a long time coming
this song feel like the greatest of all time coming
cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
who'd have thought we'd be running rap when we was knee high
to appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
or cause I'm famous you don't gotta know what pain is
but I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I aint looking back

but one thing I never lose is my grind
my closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can't sleep cause I dont like the sh-t I dream about
hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
and then help me get my genius out
and get back to what I had
if my good's outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it's on my diary, I'm living for my kids
now they is just as fly as me
talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

EMPTY MY HANDS by Tenth Avenue North


I've got voices in my head and they are so strong
And I'm getting sick of this oh Lord, how long
Will I be haunted by the fear that I believe
My hands like locks on cages
Of these dreams I can't set free

But if I let these dreams die
If I lay down all my wounded pride
If I let these dreams die
Will I find that letting go lets me come alive

So empty my hands
Fill up my heart
Capture my mind with you

These voices speak instead and what's right is wrong
And I'm giving into them, please Lord, how long
Will I be held captive by the lies that I believe
My heart's in constant chaos and it keeps me so deceived

But if I let these dreams die
If I could just lay down my dark desire
If I let these dreams die
Will I find you brought me back to life

So empty my hands
Fill up my heart
Capture my mind with you

'Cause my mind is like a building burning down
I need your grace to keep me, keep me from the ground
And my heart is just a prisoner of war
A slave to what it wants and to what I'm fighting for

Was my worship more than just a song

I want to live like that
And give it all I have
So that everything I say and do
Points to You

If love is who I am
Then this is where I'll stand
Recklessly abandoned
Never holding back

I want to live like that
I want to live like that

Am I proof
That You are who you say You are
That grace can really change our heart
Do I live like Your love is true

People pass
And even if they don't know my name
Is there evidence that I've been changed
When they see me, do they see You

I want to live like that
And give it all I have
So that everything I say and do
Points to You

If love is who I am
Then this is where I'll stand
Recklessly abandoned
Never holding back

I want to live like that
I want to live like that

I want to show the world the love You gave for me
I'm longing for the world to know the glory of the King

I want to live like that
And give it all I have
So that everything I say and do
Points to You

If love is who I am
Then this is where I'll stand
Recklessly abandoned
Never holding back

I want to live like that
I want to live like that
I want to live like that

With tear stains on her eyes 
From the places she's wandered 
And the shame she can't hide 

She says, ""How did I get here? 
I'm not who I once was. 
And I'm crippled by the fear 
That I've fallen too far to love"" 

But don't you know who you are, 
What's been done for you? 
Yeah don't you know who you are?

You are more than the sum of your past mistakes, 
You are more than the problems you create, 
You've been remade.

That she's been given new life 
But she can't shake the feeling 
That it's not true tonight 

She knows all the answers 
And she's rehearsed all the lines 
And so she'll try to do better 
But then she's too weak to try 

But don't you know who you are? 

You are more than the choices that you've made, 
You are more than the sum of your past mistakes, 
You are more than the problems you create, 
You've been remade. 

You are more than the choices that you've made, 
You are more than the sum of your past mistakes, 
You are more than the problems you create, 
You've been remade.

But what's been done for you. 
This is not about where you've been, 
But where your brokenness brings you to 

This is not about what you feel, 
But what He felt to forgive you, 
And what He felt to make you new. 

You are more than the choices that you've made, 
You are more than the sum of your past mistakes, 
You are more than the problems you create, 
You've been remade. 

You are more than the choices that you've made, 
You are more than the sum of your past mistakes,

I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

I danced for the scribe and the pharisee
They would not dance, they wouldn't follow me
So I danced for the fishermen James and John
They come with me and the Dance went on:

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

I danced on the Sabbath and cured the lame
The holy people, they said it was a shame!
They whipped and stripped and then hung me high
Left me there on a cross to die!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black
It's hard to dance with the devil on your back
They buried my body and they thought I'd gone
But I am the Dance and I still go on!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

They cut me down but I leap up high
I am the Life that will never never die!
I live in you if you live in Me
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!

Dance then, wherever you may be
For I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!

Lights Ellie Goulding

I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone home

Voices I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing.
And I think back to when my brother of my sister slept
In an unknown place the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

Humanity by Tim be Told

We are slaves to these age-old afflictions
Fighting for control 'till we fell too far
Pursue desire, ignore our convictions
Only wretched souls beneath the weeping stars

We are calling out in the thick of the war
I am standing down to fight for something more
Would we cease these battles, let this love resound
Still too hard to find our common ground

There's a fire that stays bold and courageous
There's a light to light the way
There's a fire that stays bold and courageous
There's a light to light the way

And we try so hard to heal our diseases
We break to pieces when our hope has failed
Some will live or die without a reason
Such are the seasons, still our faith prevails

We are lost and found and beg to be restored
We keep falling down, harder than before
But love will find a way to give us strength to carry on
Sorrow for now, but someday soon will be gone

There's a fire that stays bold and courageous
There's a light to light the way
There's a fire that stays bold and courageous
There's a light to light the way

So we come and go, it's still a mystery
And we'll be history long before we find
All the secrets since now and forever
We hope for better on the other side

God, hear the cries of Your people!

There's a fire that stays bold and courageous
There's a light to light the way
There's a fire that stays bold and courageous
There's a light to light the way

I can see my future slip away
Honey you won’t get there if you don’t believe

We starting fires, we starting fires
'Til our lives are burning gold

Looking for my ticket to a higher place
I can see my chance begin to fade
One step forward and two back again

Oh, Lord, how You love me
How You love me

It took more than my strength
To simply be still
To seek but never find
All the reasons we change
The reasons I doubt
And why do loved ones have to die?

But You love me anyway
It’s like nothing in life that I’ve ever known

But You love me anyway
I am the sweat from Your brow
But You love me anyway
I am the nail in Your wrist
But You love me anyway
I am Judas’ kiss
But You love me anyway

See now, I am the man who yelled out from the crowd
For Your blood to be spilled on this earth shaking ground
Yes then I turned away with the smile on my face
With this sin in my heart tried to bury Your grace
And then alone in the night I still called out for You
So ashamed of my life, my life, my life

When my world is going crazy,

For the will to carry on
For everything you do,

I just reach for you and
I can reach the sky again.
I can do anything

'Cause your love inspires me.

For pleasures earthly goods afford.

'Cause I need some comfort, to regain my sanity
I don't want to feel this crazy,
I don't want to feel discarded
Shattered in a million pieces
I'm so broken hearted
No where left to run
No where left to go
So I hope

I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answers
'Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in?
And no one would notice
Nobody noticed
That it's me, where it begins
And I pray for forgiveness within

I swear that everyday I feel like my mind is haunting me
I think of every little stupid mistake that has been made
This time I don't have the strength to gather myself
I'm falling to pieces

And I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answer
'Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in?
Pray for forgiveness
Looking for justice
Searching for answers
Call to my mother
Pray for forgiveness
Breaking the silence

Nobody knows it, nobody noticed
That it's me
Where it begins"
"664","664","I was taking a trip on a plane the other day, just wishin' that I could get out.
When the man next to me saw the book in my hand and asked me what it was about.
So I settled back in my seat. ""A best-seller,"" I said, ""a hist'ry and a myst'ry in one.""
Then I opened up the book and began to read from Matthew, Mark, Luke and John...

He was born of a virgin one holy night in the little town of Bethlehem.
Angels gathered 'round Him underneath the star singing praises to the great I AM.

He walked on the water, healed The lame, and made the blind to see again.
And for the first time here on earth we learned that God could be a friend.
And though He never, ever did a single thing wrong, the angry crowd chose Him.
And then He walked down the road and died on the cross and
that was the end...of the beginning.""

""That's not a new book, that's a Bible,"" he said, ""And I've heard it all before.
I've tried religion, it's shame and guilt, and I don't need it anymore.
It's superstation, made-up tales, just to help the weak to survive.""
""Let me read it again,"" I said, ""But listen closely. This is gonna change your life.""

""He was born of a virgin one holy night in the little town of Bethlehem.
Angels gathered 'round Him underneath the star singing praises to the great I AM.

He walked on the water, healed the lame, and made the blind to see again. 
And for the first time here on earth we learned that God could be a friend. 
And though He never, ever did a single thing wrong, the angry crowd chose Him. And then He walked down the road and died on the cross and that was the end...of the beginning.""

""The end of the beginning?"" he said with a smile. ""What more
could there be? He's dead. You said they hung Him, put nails in
His hands and a crown of thorns on His head."" I said, ""I'll read it
again, but this time there's more.

And I believe that this is true: His death wasn't the end but the beginning of life that's completed in you.
Don't you see, He did all this for you...""

""He was born of a virgin one holy night in the little town of
Bethlehem. All the angels singing praises to the great I AM.
He walked on the water, healed the lame, and made the blind to see.
And for the first time here on earth, did you know that God could be a friend?
And though He never, ever did a single thing wrong, He was the one the crowd chose.
And then He walked and He died, but three days later, three days later, three days later...
He rose! Three days later He rose!

You see, He came, He lived, and He died, but that was the end of the beginning."

I've heard about this baby boy
Who's come to earth to bring us joy
And I just want to sing this song to you
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
With every breath I'm singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah

A couple came to Bethlehem
Expecting child, they searched the inn
To find a place for You were coming soon
There was no room for them to stay
So in a manger filled with hay
God's only Son was born, oh Hallelujah
Hallelujah

The shepherds left their flocks by night
To see this baby wrapped in light
A host of angels led them all to You
It was just as the angels said
You'll find Him in a manger bed
Immanuel and Savior, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

A star shown bright up in the east
To Bethlehem, the wisemen three
Came many miles and journeyed long for You
And to the place at which You were
Their frankincense and gold and myrrh
They gave to You and cried out Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I know You came to rescue me
This baby boy would grow to be
A man and one day die for me and you
My sins would drive the nails in You
That rugged cross was my cross, too
Still every breath You drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah



===================================
Cohen's Lyrics

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who has seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Third, a Human Character (may be same soloist as second), talking to people, (lines represented by a P)- also, I see this as more of a general concensus of people so may work better as a unison duet.
This is just a possible way to break up lines.

Even before the day begins
Yeah, I’m worn
I’ve lost my will to fight
I’m worn
So, heaven come and flood my eyes

Let me see redemption win
Let me know the struggle ends
That you can mend a heart
That’s frail and torn
I wanna know a song can rise
From the ashes of a broken life
And all that’s dead inside can be reborn
Cause all that’s dead inside will be reborn

Though I’m worn
Yeah I’m worn"
"701","702","Oh, great God
Be small enough to hear me now

There were times when I was crying
From the dark of Daniel's den
And I had asked you once or twice
If you would part the sea again

Tonight I do not need a
Fiery pillar in the sky
Just want to know you're gonna
Hold me if I start to cry

Oh, great God
Be small enough to hear me now
Oh, great God
Be close enough to feel me now
(Oh great God be close to me)

There have been moments when I could not face
Goliath on my own
And how could I forget we marched
Around our share of Jericho's

But I will not be setting out
The fleece for you tonight
Just wanna know if everything will be alright
Oh, great God be close enough to feel me now

Oh, praise and all the honor be
To the God of ancient mysteries
Whose every sign and wonder
Turn the pages of our history

But tonight my heart is heavy
And I cannot keep from whispering, whispering
Are you there?

And I know you could leave writing
On the wall that's just for me
Or send wisdom while I'm sleeping
Like in Solomon's sweet dreams

I don't need the strength of Sampson
Or a chariot in the end
Just wanna know you still know how many
Hairs are on my head

Oh, great God
(Are you small enough)
Be small enough to hear
Me now

"702","703","[Verse 1:]
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

[Chorus:]
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You lay down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me

[Verse 2:]
Who brings our chaos back into order
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
The King of Glory, the King of Glory

Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

[Chorus]

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy, worthy, worthy

I was there for you
In your darkest nights

Take my voice, and let me sing always, only, for my King.
Take my lips, and let them be filled with messages from Thee.
Take my silver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use every power as Thou shalt choose.

Here am I, all of me, take my life, it's all for Thee

Take my will, and make it Thine; it shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart, it is Thine own; it shall be Thy royal throne.

Yo, just an adolescent with a dream
My life's a movie
I projected on the screen
And the storyline's borderline tragic
So many plot twists
I wonder how I got casted
Then it got drastic
Not to be sarcastic
when I say I found new life
inside a casket
I had to bury myself
my ego
No shame in crying for help
a hero
is what they wanted
I just wanted to deliver
Didn't mean to disappoint
No point in crying
you a river
So I'm sticking to the lakes that
I'm used to
Tender-loving care
for the world
and my future
It's like I see it in a whole
new light
I been clingin’ onto what hurts way too tight
I do have a choice
learned to listen
with my heart, not my ears
and I heard a voice
what was it sayin’

Let go of every sorrow you hold
Watch the dead come to life in this Valley of Bone
We’ll light a fire in this darkness below

Glow (oh x4) Oh Whoa (oh x3)

Yo, at times
the glow can get so dim
Things are flawed
and the walls they just close in
And I know home
feels like the worst place
Don't wanna stay there
for long like first base
It’s like a soap opera
seein' your folks drama
thinkin' why even get
married in the first place
On the flip side
You feel so lonely
waitin' for Mr. Right
keep meeting Mr. So Phony
He says he'll treat you like a queen
Yeah, barely knows what that means
You're a father of three
and hard workin’
Tryin’ to make a honest livin'
but not certain
Worried ‘bout tomorrow
‘cause you're broke today
They can take your job
but never your hope away
You do have a choice
Learn to listen with
your heart, not your ears
and you'll hear a voice
sayin’

I’m not sayin’
that the pain can
be avoided
It’s part of the ride
might as well enjoy it
and it’s okay to stumble and fall
as long as you pick yourself up
It humbles us all
A million-and-one stories
under the stars
Hopefully I can
be the one that you call
Through our trials
We can grow together
C’mon
We can make

I've had some hills to climb 
I've had some weary days 
And some sleepless nights 

But when I look around 
And I think things over 
All of my good days 
Outweigh my bad days 
I won't complain 

Sometimes the clouds are low 
I can hardly see the road 
I ask a question, Lord 
Lord, why so much pain? 
But he knows what's best for me 
Although my weary eyes 
They can't see 
So I'll just say thank you Lord 
I won't complain 

The Lord 
Has been so good to me 
He's been good to me 
More than this old world or you could ever be 
He's been so good 
To me 

He dried all of my tears away 
Turned my midnights into day 
So I'll just say thank you Lord 
I've been lied on 
But thank you Lord 
I've been talked about 
But thank you Lord 
I've been misunderstood 
But thank you Lord 
You might be sick 
Body reeking with pain 
But thank you Lord 
The bills are due 
Don't know where the money coming from 
But thank you Lord 
Thank you Lord 
Thank you Lord 
I want 
I want to thank God

"724","725","Jesus, I must confess
That in all my loneliness
I've forsaken and I've sinned
Leaving fragments of a man so broken // realized the world and i are so broken

I could tell You what I've done
Or should I tell You where I went wrong?
Well, the more that I start to play //try to ignore
My deceitful, evil ways keep growing stronger by the day //stronger than before

Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul
For I have walked a sinful road
So I'm gonna get down on my knees
Beg forgiveness to help set me free
Lord, have mercy on me please


Mother Mary full of Grace
In my weakness, I've lost faith
I've been careless and I have been warned
And the devil inside me is torn //not sure how to change this
God bless the men that I have scorned//could just get rid of this verse?

Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul
For I have walked the sinful road
So I'm gonna get down on my knees
Beg forgiveness to help set me free
Lord, have mercy on me, please

Oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh

So don't let me fool around no more
Send Your Angels down to guide me through that door
Well, I've gone and confessed my regrets
And I pray I'm not held in contempt// -> i pray for freedom from sin's torment
I'm so lost, and I need You to help me repent //a little confused about ""help me repent"".. so could change to: ""i'm so lost, and i need You to help, I repent""

Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul
Oh, I'm begging, I'm pleading, I'm needing
I want You to know, yeah

Struggling in your strength, resting in your truth
Jesus, you're so beautiful, you give vision to the blind
You in us, the hope of glory, in you we will abide

Inside we're renewed, as you remain
The hope of glory far outweighs
The light affliction of our days

Struggling in your strength, resting in your truth

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;

How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

Can never see its purpose

Of the mountain's mighty face

Than the stones that form the base?

You can never see through the eyes of man

Has he truly lost his worth?
Or is it the beginning
Of a new and brighter birth?

So how do you measure the worth of a man
In wealth or strength or size?
In how much he gained or how much he gave?
The answer will come
The answer will come to him who tries
To look at his life through heaven's eyes

And that's why we share all we have with you
Though there's little to be found

There's a lot to go around

By the winds of change and chance

And though you never know all the steps
You must learn to join the dance
You must learn to join the dance

So how do you judge what a man is worth?
By what he builds or buys?

Look at your life through heaven's eyes!"

"738","739","No more than a hundred years are we given 
And we spend most of that to survive than barely living 
As soon as we’re born, we’re starting to die, to be immortal is still just a lie 
Running a race, no one is winning 
Is it true in one man, we are forgiven 
That he held our souls in his hands from the beginning 
Or is this just one chance that we get to live our lives without regret 
pay no heed to whether or not we are sinning 

Will we live forever, will the saints receive their crowns 
Will we be remembered, when we’re six feet under the ground 
Or can a short life, still make a mighty sound 

All the wars and disease and the cries and pleas and the fearing, 
and the faith that we had long ago now disappearing 
Millions of souls beg you to hear, for most of us you’re hardly near 
We still pray, hoping you’re listening 

Will this last forever, will our hopes and dreams be drowned 
Our prayers never remembered as our tears soaked through the ground 
Or can a small voice still make a mighty sound 

Can a fearful heart still find courage when there’s no more faith to be found 
Can a broken world, still make a mighty sound 

Will we live forever, will the lost and last be found 
Our sorrows never remembered, as every knee falls to the ground 
And a short life will make a mighty, 
and a million voices will make a mighty, 
and a broken world will make a mighty sound  "

He said, ""I've been where you've been before.
Down every hallway's a slamming door.
No way out, no one to come and save me.
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me.

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you,
Opened my eyes and told me the truth.""
They said, ""Just a little faith, it'll all get better.""
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

Well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying, ""God, if you're there come and rescue me.""
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing along to amazing grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water (amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (how sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (that saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (like me)
Oh, yeah

Stronger (but now I'm found)

I woke up this morning
Saw a world full of trouble now
Thought, how’d we ever get so far down
How’s it ever gonna turn around
So I turned my eyes to Heaven
I thought, “God, why don’t You do something?”
Well, I just couldn’t bear the thought of
People living in poverty
Children sold into slavery
The thought disgusted me
So, I shook my fist at Heaven
Said, “God, why don’t You do something?”
He said, “I did, I created you”

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, it’s time for us to do something
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
It’s not enough to do nothing
It’s time for us to do something

I’m so tired of talking
About how we are God’s hands and feet
But it’s easier to say than to be
Live like angels of apathy who tell ourselves
It’s alright, “somebody else will do something”
Well, I don’t know about you
But I’m sick and tired of life with no desire
I don’t want a flame, I want a fire
I wanna be the one who stands up and says,
“I’m gonna do something”

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, it’s time for us to do something

Now it's time to break free.

Open my eyes.
Someone is needing You.
So I gotta Make A Move.

When this world hurts.
Real faith will come through.
When I Make A Move.

Remember when I broke you down to tears

I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done

One thing, He had to do
To come down from heaven and make us new
He took the fall, it was one for all
He put down the great wall

To find a way out of my poverty
Thinking that I could build Him a property
Remembering all the things He's done for me
I’m surprised it came so (far)
Things aren’t the way they were before

I want to be unmovable and unshakable,
so that my roots go down deep,
unmovable and unshakable in you. (x2)

planted by the streams of living water. (x2)

If your feet are planted on this planet, then you're a seed.
But are you rooted in the soil, or rooted in the granite?
Please examine the tree's advantage when it's organic:
Doesn't find its strength in a man-made hand but in the land that it's been granted.
A hollow ground where a slew of trees supersede,
I'm living among a new breed, we're bearing fruit; that's routine.
We rooted in the true king. 
I say look, if we're called to take root,
I want to take my roots and never break loose.

I don't want to be another seed who's seeking the weeds of defeat when I need, when I'm weak, and I want to reach deep
underneath, want to be a living image of a tree
Sometimes I got to let the music speak for me (Why?)
cause it's hard to say, (so?)
so in this case I just let the guitar play

unmovable and unshakable in you.

Hooked up on his grace, a product of forgiveness.
Trees planted by the waters at the bottom of the inning,
and all the fruit that I'm bearing is a product of decisions.
So if I sow into the wind, I reap a tornado;
The goal of my only intent is to keep this on your radars.
The decisions that you make and land you in the graveyards - 
Guess it depend on how you decide to build up with the bulk of them [legos?]
So the king put you down,
and the air we breathe was born to be impactful, 
got a platform for the Word.  We got purpose, 
It's our purpose leaving our footprints in the dirt
[and they say surface?] We got His word to keep Him first, We the Church.

Faith is something I am not accustomed to

I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there wringing wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me? You said, you've always got your hands out
And I cannot continue on my own so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin but I built a house and I still live in it
Afraid to open up the door to you 'n let you into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
I know, I've told you I do not need your protection
But I lied to you, this thing is tiring

Or pick it up
It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control - I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity you've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hole if you are not the center piece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling than when I look in the sky, in your eyes

But I'm living proof
Grace wins every time

No more lying down in death's defeat
Now I'm rising up in victory
Singing hallelujah
Grace wins every time

For the prodigal son, grace wins
For the woman at the well, grace wins
For the blind man and the beggar, grace wins
For always and forever, grace wins
For the lost out on the street, grace wins
For the worst part of you and me, grace wins
For the thief on the cross, grace wins
For a world that is lost

There's a war between guilt and grace
And they're fighting for a sacred space
But I'm living proof
Grace wins every time

No more lying down in death's defeat
Now I'm rising up in victory
Singing hallelujah
Grace wins every time

Every time
I'm living proof grace wins every time"

Yeah I wonder if there's anybody else
Who's 'bout ready to go home

[Jimmy Needham:]
I just wanna go where
I'm only breathing Your air

Take me there
I just wanna see You
Brighter than I'm used to
Finally see You clear, take me there
Take me there, take me there

[Trip Lee:]
Tell me, have you ever seen a
Brother so weighted you can tell by his demeanor
That he's really jaded, tryna get off this arena
He long for something greater but they say he just a dreamer
But he has a treasure that he holds like gold
'Cause he knows something that the boys don't know
Nothing seems funny when his money's so low
But when he thinks about that place, man he really wants to go
That he ain't all obsessed with the cash he can stack
'Cause he's lookin' at the Heavens where His master is at
But he does have treasure and he's storin' it up
Seems foreign to us, it can't be stolen or rust
So when the cares of this world start weighin' on him hard
And he's tired of them bills he's been payin' on his car
He can't wait to be embraced by the Lord, face to face
So he waits for his reward, and he sings

Tell me, have you ever seen her
She's sick with a disease and it's really tryna beat her
It's takin' all her strength, she know that it can't defeat her
'Cause she gon' be with Jesus, she's more than just a dreamer
Her peace and her joy, man they really ain't gone
It's all because she knows earth really ain't home
And even when she's by herself she's really not alone
Her Savior's there with her while she singin' this song
She know sickness might get her and death might grab her
But she ain't scared of death 'cause she's trusted in the Master
Was buried but He rose up a few days after
So death may attack her but death cannot have her
So she tells her family ""Don't worry anymore""
When she's gone from the body she'll be present with the Lord
Her body will be raised, so much Glory is in store
He is her reward so she sings

Hey, I ain't know about you but I can't wait till the day
When I'll be with my Lord and everything is ok
And I'll be just like Him, so my sin ain't in the way
Baskin' in His glory, that's where I wanna stay
A place where shadows give way to the real
And circumstances can't change the way that I feel
Joy of my Savior, they say we can't steal
Because he's been defeated, yeah you know the deal
The real good life, I can't wait, please save me soon
Until then I'll be praisin' in the waitin' room
Fightin' by His grace, can't wait to embrace the groom

Here I am once again
I've been shaken by the question 
Where's my place?
No where to hide deep in side 
There's a fight to find the answer 
So I pray

One breath from you 
And I can breathe 
One word from you 
And I can see 

I'm closer than the angels
Joy of your creation
Oh the way you see me
Is who I am 
Beautiful and treasured 
Loved beyond measure 
I'm on my knees 
Cause I know where I stand 
Closer than the angels
Closer than the angels

All along I belong
To the God who made the heavens 
You made me
A picture of your majesty
You gave your life 
So I can be 

Closer than the angels
Joy of your creation
Oh the way you see me
Is who I am 
Beautiful and treasured 
Loved beyond measure 
I'm on my knees 
Cause I know where I stand

Than everything I am
I'm lifting empty hands
As I stand
So how can I give less
Than everything I am
I'm lifting empty hands
As I stand

Closer than the angels

Beautiful and treasured 
Loved beyond measure

My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.

O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain,
That morn shall tearless be.

I dare not ask to fly from thee;
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red

Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,

His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

Refrain:
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure—
The saints’ and angels’ song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call,
God’s love so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
The saints’ and angels’ song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made,
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."

""Death Has Died""

Verse 1
It was just last week that my grandma died
It's been years since I've seen family on my fathers side
A bitter sweet, moment but tell me why
Nothing less then the sting of death brought us together 
I sat and listened to the priest tell lies
To appease loved ones in their seats
When you looking at a face that's weaping
The grim truth wont bring'em no peace
So I put on, all white gloves like Mr. Jackson
Carried the casket to the Cadillac then
I realised this is the first time that me and my brothers ever did something together
Whatever, I'm grown now come on let's just put on the smiles
And take pictures, take pictures
Uh
Eat this humble pie then leave them dishes
For somebody else to clean 'em until I see ya'll again

Pre-Chorus
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Br-br-Breakin' down, breakin' down)
It's all breaking down down down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down 
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
But this wont be forever no

Chorus
You used to make me cry
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died

But until that day
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh,
This won't be for ever

Verse 2
I hopped off the plane
My God, what a scene that I seen on that TV screen
People huddled round, hands on they mouth
Not again, same problem, it hit a new town
26 dead, 20 of 'em kids
Where do you begin when some lives just ended?
And everybody got the question:
If God's so good how He let this happen?
Is it mental health? Is it gun control?
Is it we make superstars out of animals?
Is it the movies we make? The video games?
I dunno, but God I want an antidote
All I know is this world is broken
Our sin is the reason it ain't like it's supposed to 
Words fall short tryna comfort the grieving
But you gotta know that there's hope to believe in

Bridge
One day my God gon' crack the sky
He gon' bottle up every tear that we ever cried
Bring truth to every lie, justice for ever crime
All our shame will be gone and we'll never have to hide
No more broken hearts, no more broken homes
No more lockin' doors, no more cops patrollin'
No abusive words, or abusive touches
No more cancerous cells that'll take our loved ones
No more hungry kids, no more natual disaster
No child will ever have to ask where his dad is
No funerals where we wear all black
And death will be dead and we'll lock the casket
Yes!

Chorus
You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right (all things right)
And we'll sing death has died
But until that day
You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died

But until that day
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh,
This won't be forever"

Tryna fall for you but then they put me on blast
It's like I try to speak my mind because I know that I'm His
And yep I try to speak my mind but it don't fly with them kids
Man if I'm not talkin' bout the newest Nikes or releases
They put the mute on me
I can't speak about my Jesus?
Like I'm living for Him

I turn around and make the amends
I try to fit it
I mess it up and stumble again
I'm takin' this pen
And writing everything so I remember just how sweet that it is
Yeah man I got issues I can't even lie
My only saving grace is knowing I got You inside
I'm done with (saving face) I ain't gotta thing to hide

So deep that they can't believe we sold out seats and them CDs
Please don't sleep on the beat I.....beat up these
Still don't get it would you keep up please
We ain't no heroes for sale, if you bought one better keep your receipt
OK I get it I know what they thinking
We some kumbaya singing corny Christians keep your distance
Buy a ticket to a concert pay a visit think it's odd
We them blues brothers 116 on a mission from God
I don't think they get it I really think what they gotta do is see it to believe it I wasn't planning on leaving them
Gimme the microphone with no gimmicks I'm really living this authentic
I may not condone it but I don't condemn it and
You ever wanna get it well tell 'em to come and get it
I point 'em to a God and we tell 'em we really wit Him

Tell me give em 2 years it'll go cold
But they words got ate like ocho
Imma keep it 300
Industry probably wanna see us go on
But we in it we in it we live it we give it our God gon do what he want
We fragrant, the aroma is that our God saves
Married to the Rock and I'm faithful
To take these words Beyonce
Don't it feel like we famous?
But the world don't know what our name is
But heaven knows us baby and that book of life is that A list
So I bow, I'm so rich and I ain't talking bout cheddar
But I bank on Christ go and talk to the teller
Kind of checks that I get I'll be cashing forever
Laugh at the saints that ain't a thing go
They be lacking to pay that thinking straight
Man we ain't lacking a thing brag in the faith
Paid by the blood of the Lamb that is paid
Debt is paid

Got em asking us how does this God turn ya'll into shouters, like hold up
We don't really think we better, call us perfect no never
But we glad to be called saints cause Paul called us that in the letters
We set apart for the Savior, He's led our hearts to the Maker
Forget the art that we making if we never love our neighbors
You might catch us whistling, marked to the spot straight glistening
Shining cause we filled with Him, you might wanna listen in

And we got washed in the water

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;

And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The sun forbear to shine;

Will be forever mine.

Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise

In articulo mortis 
Caelitus mihi vires 

Nearer my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee 
E'en though it be a cross 
That raiseth me. 

There let the way appear, 
Steps unto heaven 
All that Thou sendest me, 
In mercy given 

Still all my song shall be 
Nearer my God, to Thee, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee. 

Though like the wanderer, 
The sun gone down, 
Darkness be over me, 
My rest a stone, 

Angels to beckon me 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee. 

Or if on joyful wing, 
Cleaving the sky, 
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, 
Upward I fly.

Father time
Steals our days
Like a thief
There's no Price
That I wouldn't pay
To get some relief
I've become
The empy shell
Of a man I like so well
I am a living, breathing hell
Come on and resurrect me

I tried to drown the pain with a friend of mine
It didn't seem to help
Oh, she's got a pretty face with a wedding lace
But I'm still waking up with myself

I know what it means to choke it down
Driving 'til your legs get weak
I know what it's like on a Saturday night
To be alone in a crowded street

Father time
Steals our days
Like a thief
There's no Price
That I haven't paid
To get some relief
I've become
The shell of a man
I can't begin to even understand
Have I forgotten who I am?
Come on and resurrect me
Resurrect me
Resurrect me
Resurrect me
Resurrect me
Resurrect me
Come on and resurrect me"
"849","850","""Your Love Is Strong""

Heavenly Father 
You always amaze me
Let Your kingdom come in my world 
And in my life

Give me the food I need to live through today
And forgive me as I forgive the people that wrong me

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place

I walk to the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day

So why should I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need!
You know what I need!

Your love is strong

The Kingdom of the Heavens 
Is now advancing
Invade my heart
Invade this broken town

The Kingdom of the Heavens 
Is buried treasure
Would you sell yourself
To buy the one you've found?

Two things You told me
That You are strong
And You love me,
Yes You love me

Your love is strong

Our God in heaven
Hallowed be thy name above all names
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us, today, our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Keep us far from our vices and
Deliver us from these prisons"
"850","851","""Without You""
(feat. Courtney)

What do you do when you don't get better
Strong arms get too, get too weak to hold her
Oh God, give me just enough strength to make it through

Sleepless, this madness is walking me out to the ledge
And stands there beside me, shivering out on the edge
And oh God all I, all I ask is a little relief, just a moment of peace

I don't want to live without you
I'm not ready to live without you
So let's dance a little, laugh a little, hope a little more
'Cause I don't want to leave without you, without you

This thorn in my side, though it cuts and stings me
Has opened these eyes, I've never seen so clearly
And oh God, I thank You, 'cause You bring me to my knees
Back on my knees

I heard a voice from the other side singing
Hold fast, love lasts
As winter turns into summertime singing
Hold fast, love lasts
I heard a voice from the other side singing
Hold fast, love lasts
As winter turns into summertime singing
Hold fast

So let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
Yes, let's dance a little, laugh a little, and hope a little more
'Cause I don't want to leave without you
No, I don't wanna live without you, without you"

They would last forever

Over and over again

I opened my heart and the damage was done.

I needed a love that's not just pretend

You shattered the mirrors and showed me the grave
where you came and you got to me, got to me, lord,

You died and rose again to set me free.

But you don't know my life boy
You don't know my life boy
You don't know what it's been like on my wife
Don't know my fight boy
Being in the trenches steady tryna' fight my foes
And when I couldn't fight no more it brought me low, low
It brought me low I know can't bear that load

[Verse 3]
They like I here you talkin' wins but I see your losses
You celebratin' crowns but I see your crosses
That's the paradox that don't fit in your merry box
You might not understand if you walk in this pair of socks
The victor ain't the one that's winnin' seventh inning
Trophies don't go to ones that got a good beginning
When I say I win I don't mean the state I'm in
I mean that day when the gray skies fade out then
I'm winning cause I reign with Him

[Outro]
The crown of thorns
Declares you're King
A scarlet robe can't cloak Your majesty
They nailed Your hands
You mailed our death
From the cross You reigned
Your Kingdom knows no end
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus"

I’m just a broken instrument in the hands of the Greatest
So if the notes are off it’s ‘cause I ain’t nothin’ to play with
And you can fault me, but ain’t we all off key
Majorin' in the minors like there ain’t no errors behind us
Somehow he still makes these melodies with my felonies
I ain’t buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me?
Broken pieces actin' like we ain’t cracked
Man we all messed up and can’t no one escape that
We some broken people
Came from broken homes
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul
Alcoholics to addicts
English, African, Arabs
Ain’t no riches to fix it
You still broke when you have it
If you ain’t breakin' bad and you still chasing a habit
It ain’t no wonderland so we still chasing a rabbit
Ain’t a soul on the planet
That’s better than another
And we all need grace in the face of each other

[Hook]
All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can you put me back together?
I need your grace for my flaws
God I’m broken in this mess I’ve made
I need you to restore me

[Verse 2]
From Heaven we all small
Can't nobody buy tickets
You better have will call
That reaper he will call
They hurt just like me
Work just like me
Lust of the flesh the pride of life they flirt with like me
Regardless of our money we all broke together
And if we don't swallow our pride we gon choke together
Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands
Fell off the wall of purity
Doing that Humpty dance
Forget the king's horses
Forget the king's men
The King is coming to put us back together again
Been fighting since my daddy left
Fighting for approval
Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile
We Tyler Durden won't bear the burden of being less
Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest
We are outsiders, outliers
Out cry is loud, the meek inherit the earth
And God opposes the proud

I'm gonna shout when the Spirit says shout,
and obey the Spirit of the Lord.
O Spirit, come and fill me, Lord."

And despair holds me for ransom

‘Cause I know that You are near

You're right here, pulling me through
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders

I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders

You mend what once was shattered
And You turn my tears to laughter
Your forgiveness is my fortress
Oh Your mercy is relentless

"882","883","Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in (slept in)
Broken legs but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion


Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
Written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't want to see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't want to be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't want to see it
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't want to see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact I think Ima burn this room right now
Somehow this memory for some reason just won't burn down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me 'til I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But Ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

[Chorus]


Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
See my problem is I don't fix things
I just try to repaint, cover 'em up, like it never happen
Say I wish I could change. Are you confused?
Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, just keeps getting fuller it seems
The moment I walk in to it is the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around. One of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
And one of the first things I wrote was I wish I would have called
But I should just stop now, we ain´t got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing like it’s out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm going they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is: Will I ever clean the walls off in time?

[Chorus]


So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
Cause if I do, there's a chance
That they might disappear and not come back
And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up but this doors not
Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside
So stop watching
I'm not coming to the door
So stop knocking, stop knocking
I'm trapped here
Gotta keep saying I'm not locked in
I chose this
I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the wall down ain't solving the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve ´em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
Fear came to my house years ago I let 'em in
Maybe that's the problem
Cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
Cause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking?
I don't know anymore"

Oh, oh, oh ready or not
Here, here I come

I won't hide it
I'mma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here, here I come
I'mma show the world where the love is

I'm not ever selling out love
A love out loud is what it's all about
Giving everything to see the lost get found
Yeah, it's going down

You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box, right?
I want you to look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye

Ready or not

[LECRAE]
I refuse to keep this buried deep inside of me
Yeah this little light of mine, it's time to let it shine a bit
'Cause there's no point in hiding it
It's everything I am
The source of all my hope
And it's the reason why I stand
And I pledge allegiance to be somebody real
There's no more holding it back
I'm showing them how I feel 'cause love is more than a word
It's a noun, and a verb, and hiding it is absurd
Ya heard

Ready or not
Here, here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from

O the joy and O the sorrow
O the sorrow

And yet will He bring
Dark to light
And yet will He bring
Day from night

When shadows fall on us
We will not fear
We will remember
When darkness falls on us
We will not fear

When we're thrown and we're tossed
We remember the cost
We rest in Him
Shadow of the cross

[Rap:]
With every breath I take, every heartbeat
Sunrise and the moon lights the dark street

Every dance, every glance, every note of a song
It's all a gift undeserved that I should have known

Every day that I lie, every movement I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning Your judgment

Without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed
There's no celebration

So in times that are good, in times that are bad
Or any times that I had it all, I will be glad

And I will boast in the cross I will boast in my pains
Boast in the sunrise, boast in His reign

What's my life if it's not praising You?
Another dollar in my bank account a vain pursuit

I don't count my life at any value or precious at all
Let me finish my race, let me answer my call

When shadows fall on us
We will not fear
We will remember
When darkness falls on us
We will not fear
We will remember

When all seems lost
When we're thrown and we're tossed
We remember the cost
We rest in Him
Shadow of the cross

When shadows fall on us
We will not fear
We will remember
When darkness falls on us
We will not fear
We will remember

When all seems lost
When we're thrown and we're tossed
We remember the cost
We rest in Him
Shadow of the cross"

My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me"

"917","918","Henry, you've been waiting and now this day has arrived
Why did it take the rock bottom to make you realize
What you've been missing is something that's very valuable?
A timeless gift that will ease your mind and rapture your soul

Look with your heart, not your eyes, you'll see the miracle
That hope is here and it's making itself available
This is your chance
If you miss it then you may miss it all, it's critical

Love is here
(No matter where you are)
Love is here
(You can't escape your heart)

Love is here
(It's more than we deserve)
Love is here
(You keep hearing these words)
Love is here, love is here, love is here

Faith is waiting and hoping that in time you'll arrive
And though you're walking and breathing
Henry, you're not alive
You know that this way is not the way you were meant to live

Why do you hold yourself back
When you have so much to give?
And though you run away
Mercy can see your every move
It follows you

And though you run away
Mercy can see your every move
It follows you

Love is here, love is here, love is here
No, you don't have to look no more
No, you don't have to look no more
Love like you never felt before
Love like you never felt before

Love is here
He'll never leave, leave you alone
He's all you need, His love will be here"
"918","919","""Clear The Stage""

Clear the stage and set the sound and lights ablaze
If that's the measure you must take to crush the idols
Jerk the pews and all the decorations, too
Until the congregation's few, then have revival
Tell your friends that this is where the party ends
Until you're broken for your sins, you can't be social
Then seek the Lord and wait for what he has in store
And know that great is your reward so just be hopeful

'Cause you can sing all you want to
Yes, you can sing all you want to
You can sing all you want to
And still get it wrong; worship is more than a song

Take a break from all the plans that you have made
And sit at home alone and wait for god to whisper
Beg him please to open up his mouth and speak
And pray for real upon your knees until they blister
Shine the light on every corner of your life
Until the pride and lust and lies are in the open
Then read the word and put to test the things you've heard
Until your heart and soul are stirred and rocked and broken

'Cause you can sing all you want to
Yes, you can sing all you want to
You can sing all you want to
And still get it wrong; worship is more than a song

We must not worship something that's not even worth it
Clear the stage, make some space for the one who deserves it

Anything I put before my God is an idol
Anything I want with all my heart is an idol
Anything I can't stop thinking of is an idol
Anything that I give all my love is an idol

'Cause I can sing all I want to
Yes, I can sing all I want to

And we can sing all we want to
And we can sing all we want to
We can sing all we want to
And still get it wrong
Worship is more than a song

Clear the stage and set the sound and lights ablaze
If that's the measure you must take to crush the idols"

I will glory in my Redeemer
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me

My only Savior before the holy Judge
The Lamb who is my righteousness

My life He bought, my love He owns

Though foes are mighty and rush upon me
My feet are firm, held by His grace
My feet are firm, held by His grace

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who carries me on eagles’ wings
He crowns my life with lovingkindness

And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold

Don't Deserve You by Plumb:

You're the first face that I see
And the last thing I think about
You're the reason that I'm alive
You're what I can't live without
You're what I can't live without

You never give up
When I'm falling apart
Your arms are always open wide
And you're quick to forgive
When I make a mistake
You love me in the blink of an eye

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running and come right after me
It's what you do
And I don't deserve you

You're the light inside my eyes
You give me a reason to keep trying
You give me more than I could dream
And you bring me to my knees
You bring me to my knees

Your heart is gold and how am I the one
That you've chosen to love
I still can't believe that you're right next to me
After all that I've done

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running and come right after me

We're all trying to find a pill to numb the pain

We only pass the blame, sedate the pain, and move along

So desperately we try and try, and come to find that we are not what we've been looking for
I can't believe I'm hearing people say that all is well
I think it's time we all admit we have no good within ourselves

How to begin, can I be honest?
It took a while just to write this, well here it is.
I needed courage just to grab the pen,
The same weapon you affected me with I use to recite this,
That's my word, it's so ironic,
How these phonics are made of frequency waves that can stir,
Oceans of emotions and invoke them old things
I need composure just to compose them.
Digging up memories I tried to bury,
Unlocking tombs that I bolted
And I don't know if you'll ever hear me,
But I got salt in my wounds from the tears that resulted.
Every hurt shows we're mortal,
And every scar has a story, every story has a moral,
Every memory's a portal to the past pain
And most of the time it's caused by somebody with your last name.

[Hook:]
Like a car running into a brick wall,
Is how your words crashed into my heart
What was so minor to you was so major to me
And all I wait for is words like ""I'm sorry"", ""forgive me"".
I'm still bleeding, I'm still bleeding,
I'm still bleeding, I'm still bleeding.

[Verse 2:]
The same tongue that you used to say you love me
Was being shoved in somebody else's mouth,
Don't you touch me, I'm disgusted.
You should've just told me that you lust me,
Trust fell out from underneath me,
And the walls from the house we built fell down and then crushed me.
Walking on stilts, losing my balance,
Your words are so filthy, you don't even know the damage.
God used words to create this planet so be careful with 'em.
It isn't even really what you said, it's what you didn't
I left text and voice mails, you acting like you missed them,
I got confirmation they delivered,
You spoke silence, you just go and stay quiet like I ain't existed
Well, look at how thing's shifted
At first you blew kisses now you want some more slickness
And I ain't even got it inside me to give forgiveness
I gotta find it at the place where he said it's finished.
Yeah, you tried to kill me with your words,
But now I use words to make a living
With a DJ, oh how the tables turn,
So I'mma use mine to point people to the savior,
The one who speaks life to the dead and they wake up,
Stick and stones may break some bones
And some words scar forever, your heart forever.
Make it hard to get up, hurt people hurt people, 
See you were just bleeding and you wanted me to bleed too.

"928","929","Para que mi amor no sea un sentimiento 
Tan solo un deslumbramiento pasajero 
Para no gastar las palabras más mías 
Ni vaciar de contenido mi te quiero 

Quiero hundir más hondo mi raíz en ti 
Y cimentar en solidez, este mi afecto 
Pues mi corazón que es inquieto y es frágil 
Solo acierta si se abraza a tu proyecto 

Mas allá, de mis miedos, mas allá de mi inseguridad, 
Quiero darte mi respuesta 
Aquí estoy para hacer tu voluntad 
Para que mi amor sea decirte si, hasta el final 

Duerme en su sopor y temen en el huerto, 
Ni sus amigos acompañan al maestro, 
Si es hora de cruz, es de fidelidades, 
Pero el mundo nunca quiere aceptar eso 

Dame a comprender, Señor, tu amor tan puro 
Amor que persevera en cruz, amor perfecto 
Dame serte fiel cuando todo es oscuro 
Para que mi amor sea mas que un sentimiento 

Mas allá, de mis miedos más allá... 

No es en las palabras ni es en las promesas 
Donde la historia tiene su motor secreto 
Solo es el amor en la cruz madurado 
El amor que mueve todo el universo 

Pongo mi pequeña vida hoy en tus manos 
Por sobre mis inseguridades y mis miedos 
Y para elegir tu querer y no el mío 
Hazme en mi Getsemaní, fiel y despierto. 

Más allá, de mis miedos, más allá...


Maddie's Translation (it's pretty generalized, not exact):
My love is not a feeling
Only a passing moment
I cannot speak enough for you
Or empty the contents of my love for you

I want to sink much deeper into you (your love)
And build in strength my affection for you
My heart is restless and fragile
I can only succeed with your love (if you give me hugs)

Chorus:
Take me farther, from my fears, from my insecurities
I want to tell you my answer
Here, I am here to do your will
So that my love speaks to you, until the end

He sleeps in tiredness and fear in the garden
None of his friends accompany their teacher
At the hour of the cross, the faithfuls
But the world will never want to accept it

Give me understanding Lord, help me to understand your pure love
Love that perseveres through the cross, perfect love
Give me faith when everything is dark
So that my love is more than a feeling

Chorus

It is not in the words or the promises
Your story has a secret driving force
It is only in the love of your mature cross
The love that moves the whole universe

I put my small life in your hands
More than my fears and insecurities
And I choose your wants, not mine
Bring me to my Gethsemane, faithful and awake

And, love, if your wings are broken
We can brave through those emotions, too
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you

And faith—I think faith is having a reason
And I know now, love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine 'til yours can open, too
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you

Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you

And when you can't rise, well, I'll crawl with you on hands and knees

But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate

Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother

The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love

Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under

When you're the one who holds it all
When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world

Every single moment
You brought it all to be

With a dark heart in a small cave,
And decided to hide
For the long bitter night.
But one day someone loved you,
Let the light in, made the old new,
From some water and mud wrote you new name in blood,
But now something about it, just doesn't seem real,
Sometimes that's how it feels.

You are still a promise, the heartbeat of God.
You may have forgotten, but He has not.
You are not your ashes, you are a flame.
Do not ask the shadows, the light of the world knows,
Knows your name.

There was one day, you were certain
That He called you, cause you heard him.
And the clouds disappeared,
Everything crystal clear.
But then one day, it was not so,
Other voices you did not know
From the fray and the fringe, they were all weighing in.
And now you can't remember who has your heart.
Well here's a start.

You are still a promise, the heartbeat of God.
You may have forgotten, but He has not.
You are not your ashes, you are a flame.
Do not ask the shadows, the light of the world knows...

You're a friend of God, daughter, son
Blameless and forgiven one.
You're a slave no more, finally free
Saints and heirs, now redeemed
Your beautiful and broken heart,
Is safe and sound in His arms.
You are chosen you are His,
So remember this

You are still a promise,
You may have forgotten.

You are not your ashes, you are a flame,
Do not ask the shadows, the light of the world knows,
Knows your name
He knows your name
You are not your ashes, you are a flame,
Do not ask the shadows, the light of the world knows,
Knows your name"

You've been the price I could never pay
You've been the light that has led the way

Where could I run and ever leave behind

Through these dangers toils and snares

The people in darkness

has conquered the night

Let us build the city of God
may our tears
be turned into dancing
for the lord
our light and our love
has turned the night into day

We are sons of the morning,
we are children of day.
The one who has loved us
has brightened our way.




The lord of all kindness
has called us to be
a light for his people
to set their hearts free."

We are called, we are chosen, we are Christ for one another, we are promised to tomorrow while we are for Him today, we are sign, we are wonder, we are sower, we are seed, we are harvest, we are hunger, we are question, we are creed.

Then where can we stand justified? In what can we believe?  In no one else but he who suffered, nothing more than he who rose. 

Who was justice for the poor, who was rage against the night, who was hope for peaceful people, who was light.

[Chorus]

Then how are we to stand at all this world of bended knee?  In nothing more than barren shadows, no one else but he could save us.

Who was justice for the poor, who was rage against the night, who was hope for peaceful people, who was light.

A garden turns to a battle ground
As You collapse and You gasp at the towering foe
The terror seizes your weakened frame
You shake and heave with Your tears like rain
Now pouring down, You would drown in the pain alone
All alone

Gethsemane
Love's greatest hour
You were on Your knees
Passion and fire
And You pleaded and You prayed
Oh can there be another way?
Gethsemane

Your dearest few now fast asleep
For who could view this mystery?
Behind the veil, the travail and grief of God
You writhed and groaned as the serpent hissed
The mob approached, would it end like this?
The Prince of Peace, Heaven's King with a kiss betrayed
But you fought and prayed

Gethsemane
Love's greatest hour
Oh the agony
Lamb to the slaughter
And You sweat with drops of blood
As you faced the wrath of God
Gethsemane

Oh the fight
In the night
With the light
Of the world in darkness
Oh the pain
Oh the shame
As he prayed,
""God have you forsaken me?""
Gethsemane

Gethsemane
Raging desire
Love beyond degree
Forged in the fire
And you chose to win Your bride
On that dreadful lonely night
Gethsemane
And you raised the bitter cup
As You prayed, ""Your will be done""
Gethsemane
And You counted up the cost
But did you know it meant the cross?

Have you ever felt that way?

That after all I've done and failed to do
I feel like less than I was meant to be.

Maybe then I could get free.
I could try to be somebody else
Who's much better off than me.
But I need to remember this

I really appreciate ya'll comin' out to pray with me man
My heart's just been real heavy here lately man
I got a stack of letters here and I thought we should read a couple of 'em
And pray at the end, so I got one right here from Atlanta, it says:

Dear KB,

What's goin' on it's Ashley from the show,
That you was doin' with Trip Lee
The Crew and the Spirit was movin' man it was really dope
When y'all left the A, I was so encouraged in the faith
And I blessed the Lord for HGA
I wanna start this off by sayin' thanks

(There's a battle goin' on)
But lately, I've had this struggle with:
Secrets of my past in the past five years of singleness
(I know it) I'm lustin' I'm sinnin' but my lust here is different
Since I've been so alone I kinda long for the touch of a woman

(There's a battle goin' on)
And I know it's wrong, but dudes never ever show me attention
I go unnoticed, it was a joke but girls show me interest
Dudes at my church say that I'm the type of chick that they want (they lie)
But when I see the girl they date I know they really don't
I get jealous quick I hate the mirror I don't feel pretty
I've even contemplated surgery to feel skinny
I know it's real silly, the world tells me just embrace it - you were born this way (that's a lie, it's just lust)

I tried talking to the people at church but they just look at me funny only adding to the hurt
Now I'm torn 'cause the other day I stumbled over porn I'm supposed to be a leader man how can I move on? I know (this is a lie)
That's why I'm comin' to you prayin' I'm prayin' that you can pray for you sister to make it through
I'm crying as I write 'cause I wanna be right
Many girls have fallen and I don't wanna fall too

[Chorus:]
There's a war inside my heart and mind every day I fight it
So make me align to the truth and rely on your Spirit inside me
(It's time to make) war war war war war war 'cause life is a battlefield
War war war war war war 'cause life is a battlefield

[Swoope:]
Dear KB,

We're big fans of yours me and my lady
When you came to the show we was in the front row screamin' one one six goin' crazy all for the HGA, was a crazy night
What's even crazier is the girl I was datin' then is fiance, now I'm engaged to her
The words that you left man rocked us so I went and got her left hand rocked up
But if I could be honest I'm tryin' hard to abstain and not get her knocked up
Of course I want kids, but even more than that I wanna please the Father
But when I look into her eyes I can't concentrate man I can't even lie I wanna consummate

She's the one I'm sure, but I wanna stay pure
Scary the way that I'm yearning for her
Gettin' married but I'm burnin' for her
Hard for me to wait till she walkin' that aisle
Down in a white gown, I'm thinkin' night gown, man I wanna do it right now
Why wait when I feel like she my wife now?

The way that I'm feelin' is natural, but KB is it godly?
Is it wrong lust, or strong love the feelin' inside for wifey?
Honor the Lord in datin' her
Wanna do the same in waitin' but this temptation's a beast please pray for us

[Chorus]

[Trip Lee:]
Dear God,

We come in His name
The slain and risen Who's runnin' this thing
Christ the Lord, the one who can bring
Healin' to hurts of the ones that He claims
We think we got nothin' to gain
By clingin' to Christ the love of the King
But He was under the same
Tempted and hurt He's accustomed to pain

Know they feel it feel it
Pain but they joy can't kill it kill it
Feelin' like life been pillaged
Can I please intercede for a minute
This is
Not out of Your grasp
Your grace can shake, Your power can smash
I pray this hour and ask
Allow them to see Your power surpass

That sin, devour their past
Drown 'em with mercy, shower them fast
Give 'em the faith to follow the Father
He's Abba, Your Honor, please swallow the trash

Dear Lord, you were never gone
You promised You'd make 'em forever strong
Your arm isn't short, it is very long
Make 'em like Christ, You get 'em home

[Chorus]"
"994","995","Be still, my soul; the Lord is on thy side;
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly, Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul; thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul; the waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul; the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last."

Dear Father in the name, of Your holy Son

I desire to give, I desire to serve
I desire to love, others with more than my words
Bless me to be humble, bless me to be meek
I want to be a joy, when people come around me
Give me a gentle spirit, bless me to be content
Please keep me from my sin, let me quickly repent
Please give me discipline, give me self-control
To know when to stop, and when to say no
Make me a bold witness, please remove fear
Replace it with faith, pour out Your spirit here
Fill me up Lord, let me overflow
Let me overdose, make me holy, keep me close
I want to give it all, until there's none left
But I can't be too given, look at Your Son's death

[Verse 2: Flame]
I can see You talking to high priest, Peter just denied You
For the second time, one more time he will deny You
One of the officers smacked You in the face,
But he didn't understand that You were actually grace
But the people would rather see the release of a thief,
Than to know forgiveness and be with the Prince of Peace
And as they screamed for Pilate to crucify You,
I hear my own voice because every day I deny You
But yet You still bore the cross on Your vertebrae, walking to Golgotha
What a display of grace
I see Your weakened body beaten, can't keep me from crying
Your cross was very heavy, they gave it to Simon
Then You were crucified, they divided Your clothes
Like the Scriptures prophesied, You died and You rose
Two thousand years ago, slaughtered on the tree
You gave all of You, I'm giving all of me

Oh, I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Closer to Your heart, You will find me there

Ready to give it all, my only son as the lamb
Ready to sacrifice, everything if You ask

So who am I, to hold it with a firm grip
I give You my talent, I give You my time
I give You my eyes, I give You my mind

Dear, Uncle Chris, Uncle Keith, Uncle Ricky,
Before the Lord get me I gotta say something quickly
I grew up empty since my daddy wasn't with me shoot,
I wasn't picky I'd take any male figure
You
Stepped in at the right time,
It's 'cause of you that I write rhymes
You probably never knew that
I loved the way you used to come through,
Teach me to do the things that men do
True,
You showed me stuff I probably shouldn't have seen,
But you had barely made it out your teens,
And took me under your wings
I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you,
Lean to the side when I rolled just like you
Didn't care if people didn't like you,
You wanna bang, I wanna bang too
Skyline, pyru
You would've died, I would've died too,
You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops,
Yeah, I cried too
You never know who's right behind you,
I got a little son now and he do whatever I do
But it's something deep inside you,
That tell you it's gotta be more than doing what other guys do,
They had nobody there to guide you
But I followed your footsteps and this shouldn't surprise you,
You realize you, you realize you, you,
Yeah, I just wanna be like you

I just gotta be like you

[Verse 2:]
Now all I see is money, cars, jewels,
Stars
Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars,
Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life
Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life
If this ain't living and they lied well,
Guess I married an old wives' tale
Wow, fail
I don't know another way to go,
This is the only way they ever showed
I got this emptiness inside that got me fighting for approval 'cause I missed out on my daddy saying, way to go,
And get that verbal affirmation on know how to treat a woman,
Know how to fix an engine,
That keep the car running
So now I'm looking at the media and I'm following what they feed me,
Rap stars, trap stars,
Whoever wants to lead me
Even though they lie they still tell me that they love me,
They say I'm good at bad things at least they proud of me

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like,
I just gotta be like you

[Verse 3:]
I was created by God but I ain't wanna be like Him,
I wanna be Him
The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean
I remember the first created being,
And how he shifted the blame on his dame
For fruit he shouldn't have eaten
And now look at us all out of Eden,
Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton
Make believing
But God sees through my foolish pride,
And how I'm weak like Adam another victim of Lucifer's lies
But then in steps Jesus,
All men were created to lead but we needed somebody to lead us
More than a teacher,
But somebody to buy us back from the darkness,
You can say He redeemed us,
Taught us that real leaders follow God,
Finish the work 'cause we on our job
Taught us not to rob
But give life love a wife like He loved the Church,
Without seeing how many hearts we can break first
I wanna be like you in every way,
So if I gotta die every day
Unworthy sacrifice
But the least I can do is give the most of me
'Cause being just like you is what I'm supposed to be
They say you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I made a mess but you say you'll erase it,
I'll take it
They say you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I broke my life, but you say you'll replace it,
I'll take it.

When did I forget you've always been the king of the world
You will always be the king of the world"
"1024","1025","Lord I'm Tired, so tired of traveling
This straight and narrow is so much harder than I thought
On this road, I've met both doubt and pain
I've heard their voices say
""Boy you've given all you've got""

But there's a crowd of witnesses,
The ones who've run this race
Even louder than my fears they're crying
Warrior lift your face

And keep running, keep running
Don't look back, don't you give up now
Don't turn around
You've got to find a way somehow
Keep reaching, keep fighting
The pain cannot compare to the reward
That will be yours
That waits in store
For those who just keep running

On this path, this fight for holiness
I've struggled and I've bled
Through these dangers toils and snares.
And I've got foes,
Their siren voices call
Saying ""Boy you're 'bout to fall,
with that heavy cross you bear""

Then I remember there was one who died to win this race
He took the cross, he crushed the grave
Oh I can hear my Saviour say . .

""... keep running . . . .""

Don't turn aside
No compromise
Just lift your eyes
To the glory that's coming
If you're like me
and you feel like you can't go on
You'll never see the dawn,
And you're just about to break . .
Well don't stop now
Know that every sacrifice
It'll all be worth the price
When you finally see His face . . . . . . . .

Just keep running!
Don't lose heart, don't you give up now
Don't turn around you've got to find a way somehow
To dig deeper, run harder,
The pain cannot compare to the reward, 
That will be yours that waits in store
For those who just keep
So take my hand, because we can't do this alone
Until you hear well done,
Until your race is complete
Find a way to just
Keep running
Keep dreaming
Keep daring
Believing 
Keep working
Keep waiting
Keep serving 
Keep praying
Keep moving 
Keep trying
Keep hoping
Keep fighting
Keep going 
He's waiting
Arms open
He's coming
Keep running

Are you still there inside my chest?
I've been so worried
You've been so still

I know that you're gonna make it through
Cause there's nobody else like you

You're gonna burn brighter than a fire
Gonna blow ashes across the sky

You're the only one of you there's no replacement

To hold tightly onto what's left in my hand

The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen, who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see you tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial

And all I'm clinging to is prayers

Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waiting for 'em to attack
They say ""Don't get bitter, get better""
I'm working on switching them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keeping it together

I say pain strengthens
And fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow

Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Picking up the pieces of my life and hopin' that I'll put together
Something right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight

Just shuffling of soldiers' feet as they guarded the grave
One day, two days, three days had passed
Could it be that Jesus breathed His last
Could it be that His Father had forsaken Him
Turned His back on His Son, despising our sin
All Hell seemed to whisper, ""Just forget it, He's dead""
Then the Father looked down to His Son and said

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise, My Love

And like lightning from Heaven, the stone was rolled away
And as dead men, the guards, they all stood there in fright
As the power of love displayed its might
Then suddenly a melody filled the air
Riding wings of wind, it was everywhere
The words all creation had been longing to hear
The sweet sound of victory, so loud and clear

I think we all agree that it can't be stopped
but if we all hold our breath then how can we not
share in this connection, this empathy
so much stronger than our good times through anything
personally, i think that it's a better day
when the light shines and I see the darkness run away

Let the bad times roll
'cause I'm with you
and you're with me
let the bad times roll
'cause we're together
and that's all that matters to me

Sometimes they say
about the things you're keepin
you don't know what you got until it's gone

But I'm here to stay
of course until I'm leaving
'til life, it calls it quits and then I fall

I know there's a way
to eternity in heaven
for i will say that jesus is my truth

A smile on my face
yes, that's what i'll be keeping
when all is through, I'll come home back to you
i'll come home back to you

Let the bad times roll
'cause I'm with you
and you're with me
let the bad times roll
'cause we're together
and that's all that matters to me
to me"

She whispers to herself.
She was only 6 years old that night.
As she hid behind that shelf.
Cause daddy had a little too much to drink.
And mama didn't want her to feel the pain she felt.
But she still felt the pain...

Well 10 years they came and went,
And dad was gone.
So she looked for love in other men.
And tried to act strong.
Oh, broken hearts and scars in only places she could see.
Cause she just wanted, she just wanted to feel something.

And as she sat there on her bed,
Thinking 'bout what those girls said,
Tears streamed from her eyes.
She cried...

""If there's a God out there
Please hear my prayer.
I'm lost and I'm scared,
And I've got nowhere else to go.
I've come a long, long way.
But I'm not sure I can make it much farther...
So if you're listening, could you give a helping hand.
To your daughter.""

Well her path started to change.
She reached out and grabbed God's grace.
And finally, she saw a light.
Until the night,
Where she decided one drink was alright,
And one thing led to another.
Well next thing you know, 9 months go by,
She's a mother.

And as she laid there in that bed.
Stroking that small angel's head.
Tears streamed from her eyes.
She cried...

""If there's a God out there.
Please hear my prayer.
I'm lost and I'm scared,
And I've got nowhere else to run.
I've come a long, long way.
But I'm not sure I can be the best mother...
So if you're listening, could you give a helping hand.
To your daughter.""

Well that baby grew into a boy.
Who became her pride and joy.
He loved her like no man could.
And her heart felt peace, cause she finally understood.
God's love.

So as she laid there in that bed,
99 years old.
She grabbed her son's hand and said.
""There's something you must know...""

""There is a God up there.
Who heard my prayer.
I was lost and afraid.
And I had nowhere else to go.
I had no clue, what to do
And then He sent me you.""

So if you're lost and afraid,
And you feel so alone,
Don't worry child,
Cause there's a Father who will love you as His own.
Just like He loved His daughter.
Like He loved His daughter."

Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely, "" and ever since that day

'Til their hearts be satisfied
I will give my life to them
Whom shall I send?

[Chorus]
Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go, Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart"
"1073","1074","[Verse 1]
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything.""

[Verse 2]
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus:]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Verse 3]
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

[Chorus:]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Bridge]
Early morning
The city breaks
I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

[Chorus 3 and outro]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait?
To find me, to find me"
"1074","1075","The night sky once ruled my imagination
Now I turn the dials with careful calculation
After a while, I thought I’d never find you
I convinced myself that I would never find you
When suddenly I saw you

At first I thought you were a constellation
I made a map of your stars and I had a revelation:
You’re as beautiful as endless
You’re the universe I’m helpless in
An astronomer at my best
When I throw away the measurements

Like a telescope
I will pull you so close
’Til no space lies in between

And suddenly I see you
Suddenly I see you

I was a billion little pieces
’Til you pulled me into focus
Astronomy in reverse
It was me who was discovered

(I thought I’d never find you
When suddenly I saw you.)

Like a telescope
I will pull you so close
’Til no space lies in between

Then suddenly I see you"
"1075","1076","[Verse 1]
You taught me the courage of stars before you left
How light carries on endlessly even after death
With shortness of breath you explained the infinite
How rare and beautiful it is to even exist

[Chorus]
I couldn't help but ask
For you to say it all again
I tried to write it down
But I could never find a pen
I'd give anything to hear
You say it one more time
That the universe was made
Just to be seen by my eyes
I couldn't help but ask
For you to say it all again
I tried to write it down
But I could never find a pen
I'd give anything to hear
You say it one more time
That the universe was made
Just to be seen by my eyes

[Verse 2]
With shortness of breath, I'll explain the infinite
How rare and beautiful it truly is that we exist"
"1076","1077","[Intro: Tori Kelly]
Mmm, no
Mmm, yeah

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & The HamilTones]
There's a love so high (that you cannot get over)
That same love's so wide (it'll take forever just to get round it)
But love died somewhere
Behind that cross you wear, you're afraid when you look at me
That ain't real love
Not the kind from above, hmm

[Verse 1: Tori Kelly & The HamilTones]
But there's a friend of mine (that stays closer than a brother)
Oooh, love laid down his life (so why do we still fight one another?)
All this hate I see on the TV screen
In my country ‘tis of thee
God help us to love, to love the way that you love me
Hmmm, God help us to love the way that you love me, oh oh

[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
This world is weeping, hurting, broken and begging for change
Oh yeah
But still we marching, praying, dying, and things stay the same
When will we see?
Till everyone's free
There'll never be peace between you and me
God, your love is the cure
For the rich and the poor
God, please will you open our eyes?

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & The HamilTones]
'Cause I want a love so high (that you cannot get over)
Oooh, I want a love so wide (it'll take forever just to get round it)
No, no, no, no, no
But it don't come cheap
It takes everything to make love more than a dream

[Outro: Tori Kelly & The HamilTones]
God help us to love (God help us to love)
God help us to love (This world needs your love)
We need your love (What we need now is love)
Fill us with your love, Lord (Unconditional love)
We need your love (Rain down on us, your love)
Oh, we need your love (Fill us please with your love)
God help me to love the way that you love me"
"1077","1078","I used to be so broken, lost, empty
A heart with no beat
A singer with no song to sing
So I know the feeling
The silence is deafening
But in your pain lies a blessing
A sweeter song of victory
So keep walking, walking, walking
Though it seems so far
No matter who you are
See, there's one thing that I know
Life it can leave
You so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better, better, better

It's alright, dry your eyes
Send a prayer to the sky
I know its hard to fight
But you must believe
That it gets better

Listen to me, I know you're scared
Your heart's bleeding
But what are you gonna do now?
I think it's time you break free!

And keep walking, walking, walking
Though it seems so far
No it doesn't really matter who you are
See, there's one thing that I know ohhhhh!
Life it can leave, you so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better, better
Is alright, dry your eyes, send a prayer
To the sky. I know its hard to fight
But you must believe
That it gets better, better

Almost out of here
See, I was almost took
I wanted to die
From how I was doing wrong
I cried out every night
Looking for a helping hand
That's when it happened
Jesus took me in

He held me close
Gave me love
Refilled my heart
Helped me grow better
Because his love, it made me whole
He's available anytime
Try Him out
He'll change your life
See, cause I know Yeah

Life, it can leave
You so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better, better yeah
Life it can leave you so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better ohhhh!
It gets better, better
So much better
Better, yeah it gets better
If you only believe
So much better yeah"
"1078","1079","She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
What's a little bit of hunger?
I could go a little while longer, she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
No better you than the you that you are (no better you than the you that you are)
No better life than the life we're living (no better life than the life we're living)
No better time for your shine, you're a star (no better time for your shine, you're a star)
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
